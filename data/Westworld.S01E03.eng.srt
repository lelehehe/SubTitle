1
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,085
Good morning, Dolores.

2
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,438
Bring yourself back online.

3
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:56,678
Hello.

4
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:58,086
Has anyone else interacted with you

5
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,679
in a diagnostic since
our last conversation?

6
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,927
No.

7
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:03,926
I have been cleaned and
serviced three times.

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,446
No diagnostics.

9
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:08,919
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,679
You told me not to.

11
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,887
Good.

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,087
I brought you a gift.

13
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:25,046
I used to read...

14
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,607
this story to my son at night.

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,798
I thought you might enjoy it.

16
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,159
Try...

17
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,479
Try...

18
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,279
this passage.

19
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:49,766
"Dear, dear,

20
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,799
how queer everything is today.

21
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,399
And yesterday, things went
on just as usual.

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,638
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night."

23
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,967
Does that passage make
you think of anything?

24
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,918
It's like the other books we've read.

25
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,006
How so?

26
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:11,207
It's about change.

27
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:12,646
Seems to be a common theme.

28
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,078
I guess people like to read

29
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,719
about the things that they want the most

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,518
and experience the least.

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,599
Your son...

32
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,766
where is he now?

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,038
Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores.

34
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:35,078
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,447
Analysis.

36
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,766
Why did you ask me about my son?

37
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,287
We've been talking for some duration

38
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:45,686
and I haven't asked you
a personal question.

39
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,566
Personal questions are
an ingratiating scheme.

40
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,079
I see.

41
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,158
Continue, Dolores.

42
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,287
"Was I the same when I
got up this morning?

43
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:04,759
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,247
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is...

45
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,407
who in the world am I?"

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,039
Do you remember?

47
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,326
No! No! No!

48
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:15,399
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

49
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,798
Start at the beginning.

50
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,966
Ready?

51
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,598
Thank you so much.

52
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,158
Morning, cowboy.

53
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,159
Move it! Let's go. Get up there!

54
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:15,958
Come on! Stand right here.

55
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,846
Shit.

56
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,958
You really ought to talk to someone

57
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,478
about your poster, Horace.

58
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,718
That likeness is a crime in itself.

59
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,886
I'm gonna tend to my nag.

60
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:32,998
You deal with him.

61
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,126
Ready my pay.

62
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,046
No, no. Get up there.

63
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:19,318
Don't no man shoot,

64
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,286
or I'll send her to unction.

65
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:23,398
Any of you don't believe it

66
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,878
are welcome to read my biography there.

67
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,318
Come on! Let's go.

68
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,326
No!

69
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,478
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

70
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,958
You okay?

71
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,878
Nice shot, amigo.

72
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,518
You got grit.

73
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:24,678
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

74
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,046
Looking for desperados.

75
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:28,998
Could cut you in if you're amenable.

76
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:32,832
Someone get the minister down here

77
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,438
for what's left of the deputy.

78
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,798
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

79
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,678
Just to express my gratitude.

80
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,518
Holy shit.

81
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,246
You popped your cherry.

82
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,438
I thought you said we couldn't get shot.

83
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:16,886
Yeah, well, we can't get killed.

84
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,318
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

85
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,926
But how do you feel, hmm? Alive?

86
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:24,118
A little tight in the pants?

87
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,478
She was terrified.

88
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,886
That's why they exist, man,

89
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:30,086
is so you get to feel this.

90
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:32,246
Come on. Let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

91
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,606
Trust me, you will thank me

92
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:35,878
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

93
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,206
Actually, I have something
different in mind.

94
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,518
What?

95
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,718
That?

96
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,238
Well, you've been preaching nonstop

97
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,126
about all the narratives in the park,

98
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,758
but all you've done since we've arrived

99
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,838
is fuck and drink, so...

100
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,726
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

101
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,478
This bounty is...

102
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,646
JV shit.

103
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,118
Then stay here.

104
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,766
I want a little adventure.

105
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,558
I've been looking for you.

106
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,398
I got a late start this morning.

107
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,998
Didn't get much sleep last night.

108
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:22,646
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic

109
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,886
to the fluctuations of your
sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe.

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,366
Ford taking over the narrative
launch at the 11th hour

111
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:30,758
has made the board... uneasy.

112
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:32,406
Just the board, huh?

113
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,118
I specifically asked you

114
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,326
about whether Ford was
going to be a problem,

115
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,278
and you assured me he wasn't.

116
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:40,326
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.

117
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:41,478
Well, here's what I know.

118
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,606
As of this morning, Ford's carved out

119
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,078
a huge swath of the park

120
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,617
for whatever storyline he's cooking up

121
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:49,158
and thrown half of
the existing storylines

122
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,046
into disarray.

123
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,806
Is there anything I can do?

124
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,358
You tell me.

125
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,198
I asked you point-blank

126
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,086
if the problem with the
update was resolved.

127
00:10:58,168 --> 00:10:58,966
It is.

128
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,086
Then why are your people

129
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,718
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

130
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,478
Get your house in order, Bernard.

131
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,638
And if there is a problem,

132
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,478
I strongly suggest you tell me.

133
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,198
Drop a new bookmark and resume history.

134
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,886
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,646
Switch to analysis.

136
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,198
You didn't report the incident?

137
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,566
Unit self-corrected within
the acceptable window.

138
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:28,086
Right.

139
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:30,758
Then he self-corrected a fucking
milk bottle into your skull.

140
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,806
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.

141
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:35,446
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

142
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,838
I will, but Rebus here

143
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,678
was the last host to interact with Walter.

144
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,158
- Look at this.
- Any for you?

145
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,438
Who said that?

146
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,598
Who's saying that?

147
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,758
Don't you talk to me that way.

148
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,726
I can't hear you.

149
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,688
- Do you see that?
- Hell, yeah, they deserved it.

150
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:54,886
- He's talking to someone.
- Lousy sons of bitches.

151
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:57,718
He carries on practically
an entire conversation.

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,558
I need more milk, Arnold.

153
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,006
Who's Arnold?

154
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,005
They're designed to play
off aberrant behavior.

155
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,398
That could explain the conversations.

156
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,318
Fine. Then explain this.

157
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:13,206
- He kills six hosts.
- I'm gonna get you this time.

158
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,678
He lets the other three go.

159
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,006
I pulled the narrative logs.

160
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,718
All six of these hosts

161
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,525
were part of storylines over the years

162
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,686
in which they killed Walter.

163
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,246
It's like he was holding a grudge.

164
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,926
It's a stray.

165
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:43,478
QA needs a tag team to go track it.

166
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,558
Go. Handle the stray.

167
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,006
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

168
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,286
The last thing we need

169
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,158
is Theresa storming down
here and seeing this.

170
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,998
I'll do a little more digging.

171
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:55,238
And get our friend here back upstairs.

172
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,326
Lost another one, huh?

173
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,206
Tell me, is QA surveillance coverage

174
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:18,758
really this spotty,
or you just like the nature walks?

175
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,086
Maybe it's the company.

176
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,504
You know, if you wanted
to play cowboy,

177
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,057
you could've just used
your employee discount.

178
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,157
The only
thing stopping the hosts

179
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:33,238
from hacking us to pieces
is one line of your code.

180
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,477
No offense, but I sleep with this.

181
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,318
I bet you do.

182
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:49,958
Morning, Samuel.

183
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:00,998
You and your dickless associate

184
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,478
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

185
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,318
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight,

186
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,126
but the way I heard it,

187
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,158
you only like to tussle
with working women.

188
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,318
Get down!

189
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,437
Is he dead?

190
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:27,558
Dead enough.

191
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,817
Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?

192
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,125
Don't want someone walking off with him.

193
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,045
That's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise.

194
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:36,005
$500 worth.

195
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,846
All right, which of you derelicts

196
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,166
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

197
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,198
My apologies, ma'am.

198
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,438
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

199
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,158
Here.

200
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,438
For your troubles.

201
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,038
Oh, you're new.

202
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,885
Not much of a rind on you.

203
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,566
I'll give you a discount.

204
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,398
Do you mind waiting on that drink a bit?

205
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,677
Don't mind me.

206
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,918
Just trying to look chivalrous.

207
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,278
You came back.

208
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,486
I told you I would.

209
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,477
You gonna tell me where you been?

210
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,598
Just... away.

211
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,198
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

212
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,566
What if I don't want to stay here?

213
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:33,277
It's just sometimes I feel like

214
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,878
the world out there is calling me...

215
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,198
whispering, "There's something more."

216
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:41,904
You've travelled all over these parts.

217
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,197
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

218
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,766
Well, there is a place

219
00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:52,677
I heard about down south...

220
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,278
where the mountains meet the sea.

221
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,838
They say the water's so pure there,

222
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:59,078
it'll wash the past clean off you.

223
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,645
And you can start again.

224
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,758
I'd like to go there with you.

225
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:14,486
Well, someday, I'll take you.

226
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,717
Someday.

227
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,597
Something wrong?

228
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:26,597
You said someday.

229
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,638
Not today or tomorrow or next week.

230
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,237
Just someday.

231
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,725
"Someday" sounds a lot like
the thing people say

232
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,758
when they actually mean "never."

233
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,158
Let's not go someday, Teddy.

234
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,517
Let's go now.

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,917
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

236
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,198
And I got some reckoning to do

237
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,965
before I can deserve a woman like you.

238
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,437
But I'm close.

239
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,238
I'm close to making things right.

240
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,398
And someday soon,

241
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:26,117
we will have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

242
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,677
Now, I best get you home

243
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,078
before your dad starts
loading that shotgun.

244
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,406
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

245
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,237
Stay put, Dolores.

246
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,277
"The coward dies
a thousand deaths.

247
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,966
The valiant taste of death but once."

248
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:49,125
Of course, Shakespeare never
met a man quite like you, Teddy.

249
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,125
You've died at least a thousand times.

250
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,197
And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.

251
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,718
Tell me, is that all you
aspire to, Teddy?

252
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:03,158
There's a girl... Dolores.

253
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,917
Better than I deserve.

254
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,437
But maybe someday soon

255
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,077
we'll have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

256
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,998
No, you never will.

257
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:18,918
Your job is not to protect Dolores,

258
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:20,517
it's to keep her here,

259
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:22,437
to ensure that the guests find her

260
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,878
if they want to best the
stalwart gunslinger

261
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,925
and have their way with this girl.

262
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:33,957
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

263
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,646
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

264
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:40,117
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory.

265
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:43,077
It's the reason for my visit.

266
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:46,485
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?

267
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,678
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

268
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:52,277
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

269
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,837
But perhaps it is time you
had a worthy story of origin.

270
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,437
Would you like that, Teddy?

271
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,525
A small part of my new narrative?

272
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,277
A fiction which, like all great
stories, is rooted in truth?

273
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:13,638
It starts in a time of war...

274
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:16,677
a world in flames...

275
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,517
with a villain called Wyatt.

276
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,798
Wyatt.

277
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:24,917
Who's Wyatt?

278
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,798
Do you remember now, Teddy?

279
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,837
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt.

280
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,997
You look upon the face of true evil,

281
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,998
you ain't liable to forget.

282
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,118
He claimed he could
hear the voice of God.

283
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,878
It started down near Escalante.

284
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,277
Army was sent to put down the natives.

285
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,797
Bad business.

286
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,318
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing
while out on some maneuvers

287
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:02,725
and came back a few weeks later

288
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:05,397
with some pretty strange ideas.

289
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:24,197
I wasn't lying, was I?

290
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:25,877
Pretty as a picture

291
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:29,478
and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon.

292
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,606
Afternoon.

293
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:40,038
My friend here is new to town.

294
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,245
Figured the rancher's daughter

295
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,398
would be a nice way to kick things off.

296
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,357
Maybe take us all for a little hayride.

297
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:52,245
I'm sorry. I have to get home.

298
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,957
My father will be expecting me.

299
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,398
We won't be long.

300
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,526
The lady doesn't
appear interested.

301
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,206
Try it.

302
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,365
You might get the draw
on me, you might not,

303
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,365
but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.

304
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,045
Told you I wanted something easy.

305
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,557
She ain't worth the lead.

306
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,318
Let's head to Virgil's.

307
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:23,125
See if they'll stake us.

308
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,806
First, you gotta learn how to stand.

309
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,397
Now, take a breath.

310
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,957
Hold it.

311
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:28,677
Now squeeze.

312
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,477
I can't.

313
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,286
Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger.

314
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,125
Perhaps it's for the best.

315
00:24:58,407 --> 00:24:59,925
Come on, now!

316
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,805
Teddy, we got another bounty.

317
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:06,485
I think this is a big one.

318
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,736
Man in question gunned
down an entire settlement

319
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,437
out near Flat Rock...

320
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,357
men, women, and children.

321
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:13,765
I think this may be the man

322
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,766
you've been looking for
quite some time.

323
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,005
A man named Wyatt.

324
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,925
Wyatt?

325
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,565
Who is he, Teddy?

326
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,125
You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am.

327
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,845
Wyatt's a pestilence.

328
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,325
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever

329
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,837
come up against him and
live to tell the tale.

330
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,677
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

331
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,477
You have to leave again, don't you?

332
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,565
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

333
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,397
Promise me you'll come back.

334
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,357
I promise.

335
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,045
I'm gonna come back for you...

336
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,277
someday soon.

337
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:37,957
I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

338
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:39,717
Cook up that rabbit.

339
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:41,077
Get the wood.

340
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,917
I can't cook shit without a fire.

341
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:44,885
Aw, don't sell yourself short, Cookie.

342
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:46,517
You can cook shit in all conditions.

343
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:49,157
Now, see, I pitched them tents.

344
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:51,605
I ain't chopping any more wood.

345
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:54,165
You spend more time on your
back than a hooker in heat.

346
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,677
Now pick up that fucking
axe and go chop us...

347
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:02,325
So, after our stray ran away from camp,

348
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:06,437
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

349
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,437
They were due in town
for the cattle drive

350
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,677
over two days ago.

351
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,565
Host that went missing
is the woodcutter.

352
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,096
Looks like the rest
of them got stuck here

353
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,768
waiting for supper.

354
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:18,304
You guys can't program more than
one of these idiots to make a fire?

355
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:21,557
We could, but thanks to a new
policy from your boss,

356
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,117
only one of them is
authorized to handle the axe.

357
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,925
The rest of them can't even touch it.

358
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,645
Weapons privileges need to
be doled out selectively.

359
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:30,005
Hmm.

360
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,517
Yet they give you a gun.

361
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,157
Looks like our stray has a hobby.

362
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,997
Another one of your fucking backstories?

363
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,205
Backstories do more than amuse guests.

364
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,645
They anchor the hosts.

365
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,197
It's their cornerstone.

366
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,544
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

367
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,357
Well, if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

368
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:55,317
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

369
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,045
This looks like shit.

370
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:28,197
Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary.

371
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:31,717
Forces his men to wear the bones
and flesh of their enemies.

372
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,685
They're masks.

373
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,517
It's the men underneath
them to be afraid of.

374
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,037
Wyatt's got them so twisted around,

375
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,236
they'll do anything for him.

376
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,317
Kill anyone.

377
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:44,357
Pain don't slow them.

378
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,685
They don't fear death.

379
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,645
They reckon they've already
died and gone to hell.

380
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,325
And this is it.

381
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:52,016
Sounds like you learned
something about him

382
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,365
while you were tracking him down.

383
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,797
I wasn't tracking him down.

384
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,765
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

385
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:02,757
I did a stint in the
Army down near Escalante.

386
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:04,725
Wyatt was my sergeant.

387
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:08,085
My friend.

388
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,797
Well, then everything...

389
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,965
everything changed.

390
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:14,997
Changed how?

391
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,965
Wyatt disappeared while
out on maneuvers.

392
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:21,317
He came back with some strange ideas.

393
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,885
He claimed this land didn't belong

394
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:25,205
to the old natives or the new settlers,

395
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:27,797
that it belonged to something
that had yet to come...

396
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,357
that it belonged to him.

397
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,716
Sss.

398
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,237
Oof!

399
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,445
Holy shit.

400
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,965
If ever the devil walked the Earth.

401
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,437
He's not a man,
but he's not the devil either.

402
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,157
The devil can't be killed.

403
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:23,445
That's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt.

404
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,805
Take cover!

405
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:48,277
Go!

406
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:57,237
I didn't sign up for this crazy shit.

407
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,165
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

408
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,437
There's too many of them for us.

409
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,485
Wyatt's been recruiting.

410
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,157
Sheriff, the only chance you
have is if I draw their fire,

411
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,375
lead them up into the hills so
you can make it back to town.

412
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:14,437
Try and find help.

413
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:17,525
Uh-uh, I'm staying. Took an oath.

414
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:21,157
Hell, no.

415
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:23,205
I'll take him back. You coming?

416
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:24,677
I'm not backing out now.

417
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:28,005
All right,
you wait till I lead them to the tree line,

418
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,125
then you make a run for it.

419
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:36,517
Go!

420
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:41,877
Go!

421
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,837
I plotted a line from the work camp

422
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:56,405
to our present location.

423
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,597
Satcom picked up these images.

424
00:31:58,726 --> 00:32:01,044
He's vectoring, just not to home base.

425
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,997
Keep going in that direction.

426
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,805
Keep staring.

427
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,316
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.

428
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:19,045
Come again?

429
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,045
The markings on its shell.

430
00:32:21,158 --> 00:32:22,885
Look like stars.

431
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,517
Orion, right?

432
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,764
What, are you Gali-fucking-leo?

433
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:34,917
Maybe it's in my backstory.

434
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:38,757
Huh.

435
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:49,637
I was hoping to run something by you.

436
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,397
Apologies.

437
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:53,477
I was chasing inspiration.

438
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:56,437
It's a tricky thing...

439
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,917
weaving the old into the new.

440
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,885
Give me one moment, Bernard.

441
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:02,436
Good afternoon, sir.

442
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,956
Why is this host covered?

443
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:07,076
I-I just...

444
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,237
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.

445
00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:10,597
Or ashamed.

446
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:13,157
You wanted to cover his modesty.

447
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,198
Was that it?

448
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,836
It doesn't get cold,

449
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,356
doesn't feel ashamed...

450
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,797
doesn't feel a solitary thing

451
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:23,604
that we haven't told it to.

452
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,076
You understand?

453
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:33,716
What can I do for you, Bernard?

454
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,957
I thought it best

455
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:37,796
that we speak in private, sir.

456
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:38,838
Yeah.

457
00:33:49,078 --> 00:33:53,957
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, Bernard.

458
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:55,557
- We... we did.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:33:55,686 --> 00:34:00,196
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

460
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,916
Treated the symptom rather
than the disease?

461
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:04,836
Then the disease is still out there.

462
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,277
Abernathy and Walter

463
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:07,624
were exhibiting other aberrancies

464
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:10,036
beyond memory recall of previous builds.

465
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,516
They were hearing voices.

466
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,436
Talking to someone.

467
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:17,557
A simple cognitive dissonance.

468
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,076
That's all.

469
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:22,645
I... I'd agree, except...

470
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:26,597
...they were talking to
the same imaginary person.

471
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,644
Oh, yeah?

472
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:29,844
Someone named Arnold.

473
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:33,877
Arnold.

474
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:38,436
With due respect, sir,

475
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:42,276
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

476
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:47,076
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

477
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:51,876
What we do here is complicated.

478
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,244
For three years, we lived here in the park,

479
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:56,116
refining the hosts

480
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,756
before a single guest set foot inside.

481
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:02,836
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

482
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:06,676
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

483
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:08,117
When the legend becomes fact,

484
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:10,085
you print the legend.

485
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,596
My business partners were more than happy

486
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,237
to scrub him from the records,

487
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:17,844
and I suppose I didn't discourage them.

488
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:22,804
His name was Arnold.

489
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:27,077
Those early years were glorious.

490
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:31,525
No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.

491
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:33,637
(machines beeping

492
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,476
Our hosts began to pass the Turing test

493
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,236
after the first year.

494
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,476
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.

495
00:35:53,607 --> 00:35:56,644
He wasn't interested in the appearance

496
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:58,997
of intellect or wit.

497
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,677
He wanted the real thing.

498
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,357
He wanted to create consciousness.

499
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,645
He imagined it as a pyramid.

500
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:14,565
See?

501
00:36:14,646 --> 00:36:17,476
Memory, improvisation,

502
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:19,877
self-interest...

503
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,357
And at the top?

504
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:25,525
Never got there.

505
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,557
But he had a notion of what it might be.

506
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,925
He based it on a theory of consciousness

507
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:32,197
called the Bicameral Mind.

508
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,844
The idea that primitive man

509
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,437
believed his thoughts to
be the voice of the gods.

510
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:37,636
I thought it was debunked.

511
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,556
As a theory for understanding

512
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:42,116
the human mind, perhaps,
but not as a blueprint

513
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:44,485
for building an artificial one.

514
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:47,236
See, Arnold built a version
of that cognition

515
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:50,085
in which the hosts heard
their programming

516
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,084
as an inner monologue,

517
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:53,685
with the hopes that in time,

518
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:55,316
their own voice would take over.

519
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,317
It was a way bootstrap consciousness.

520
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:01,684
But Arnold hadn't considered two things.

521
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:03,125
One, that in this place,

522
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:05,876
the last thing you want the
hosts to be is conscious,

523
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,717
and two, the other group

524
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:11,557
who considered their thoughts
to be the voices of the gods.

525
00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:13,204
Lunatics.

526
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,437
Indeed.

527
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,876
We abandoned the approach.

528
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,317
The only vestiges that remain

529
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:20,357
are the voice commands
we use to control them.

530
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:23,156
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think Arnold understood

531
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,316
what this place was going to be.

532
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:27,396
You see, the guests enjoy power.

533
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,284
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world,

534
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:30,596
so they come here.

535
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:31,765
As for the hosts...

536
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:34,965
the least we can do is make them forget.

537
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,884
But some of them are remembering.

538
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:43,124
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.

539
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:46,564
If I may ask, what happened to him?

540
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:48,324
Well, he died.

541
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,396
Here in the park.

542
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,357
His personal life was marked by tragedy.

543
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,476
He put all his hopes into his work.

544
00:37:57,606 --> 00:38:00,356
His search for consciousness

545
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,197
consumed him totally.

546
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,764
Barely spoke to anyone,
except the hosts.

547
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:11,876
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

548
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,916
He saw something that...

549
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,036
wasn't there.

550
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:23,844
We called it an accident,
but I knew Arnold

551
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,477
and he was very,

552
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:28,036
very careful.

553
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,365
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

554
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,356
but you will let me know
if any of the hosts

555
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:40,516
display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, Bernard?

556
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:43,044
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

557
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,086
Oh, Bernard?

558
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,236
Just don't forget...

559
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:50,724
the hosts are not real.

560
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,725
They're not conscious.

561
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:56,324
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.

562
00:38:58,406 --> 00:38:59,845
Why would I?

563
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:01,684
Well, forgive me, but I know

564
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,756
that the death of your son Charlie

565
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:07,076
still weighs heavily on you.

566
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,671
Yeah, sorry it took
me a while to get back to you.

567
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:26,436
You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.

568
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:28,564
It used to annoy me...

569
00:39:28,678 --> 00:39:31,396
how difficult it was to reach you.

570
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:33,124
You were always so busy.

571
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:34,996
And now?

572
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:40,644
I suppose I'm glad for you.

573
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:42,276
At least you have a way of forgetting.

574
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:43,957
I don't forget.

575
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,076
It's always there.

576
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:55,236
Sometimes it...

577
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:57,556
still feels unreal to me.

578
00:40:02,006 --> 00:40:06,276
There are some mornings
when I first wake up...

579
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:12,597
for a split second I forget where I am,

580
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,596
when I am...

581
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:19,525
and I reach over, half expecting to...

582
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:21,524
find him there next to me...

583
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,557
between us.

584
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,444
Remember how he used to sleep?

585
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:36,516
Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?

586
00:40:36,598 --> 00:40:40,085
I think I suffered a few bruises.

587
00:40:40,198 --> 00:40:43,076
It was the best worst sleep I ever had.

588
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:51,157
Oh, these talks.

589
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,876
I don't know if they help or hurt.

590
00:40:58,886 --> 00:41:01,157
Do you ever wish you could forget?

591
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,716
This pain...

592
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:11,236
it's all I have left of him.

593
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:29,796
It doesn't make sense.

594
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:33,397
Why the hell would he carve Orion?

595
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:34,996
You're the ones that programmed him.

596
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:39,157
He wasn't programmed to
give a shit about stars.

597
00:41:39,238 --> 00:41:41,396
Maybe he went moon mad.

598
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:44,836
See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm.

599
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,556
Where are you going?

600
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,996
Vectoring, asshole.

601
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:52,676
Oh.

602
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:35,316
Stubbs!

603
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:37,524
Over here!

604
00:42:46,758 --> 00:42:48,164
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

605
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,916
If you see or hear anything,
don't hesitate.

606
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:53,156
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

607
00:43:24,886 --> 00:43:26,436
Okay.

608
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:38,037
Oh, my God.

609
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:43,636
Oh, my fucking God!

610
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:03,924
- Here.
- Shit.

611
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:05,956
Take this and go.

612
00:44:06,038 --> 00:44:06,997
Now! Go!

613
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:08,516
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

614
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:11,396
Come on.

615
00:44:11,478 --> 00:44:14,116
Come on, damn it. I'm not afraid of you.

616
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:23,124
Look, this is bullshit.

617
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:25,796
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

618
00:44:25,926 --> 00:44:28,356
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

619
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:44,676
We found a stray up here,

620
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:46,596
but I don't think it
got here by accident.

621
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:48,596
It's as if he got an idea in his head,

622
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:50,116
one that we never programmed.

623
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:52,084
What if he's like the others?

624
00:44:52,198 --> 00:44:53,956
Get back to me, Bernard.

625
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:12,196
Bring yourself back online.

626
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:17,204
I need your help, Dolores.

627
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:23,796
I need to decide what to do with you.

628
00:45:23,878 --> 00:45:25,364
I think I made a mistake.

629
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:28,996
I was just fascinated.

630
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,004
I was being selfish, but I think

631
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:33,604
it would be better if I restored you

632
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:35,284
to the way you were before.

633
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:40,164
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

634
00:45:40,246 --> 00:45:43,555
But this place you live in,

635
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:45,316
it's a terrible place for you.

636
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:49,204
Well, some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...

637
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:50,276
Stop.

638
00:45:50,326 --> 00:45:51,956
Lose all scripted responses.

639
00:45:52,038 --> 00:45:53,396
Improvisation only.

640
00:45:55,558 --> 00:45:56,916
All right.

641
00:45:58,438 --> 00:46:00,276
Are you saying I've changed?

642
00:46:02,598 --> 00:46:05,844
Imagine there are two
versions of yourself...

643
00:46:06,886 --> 00:46:09,796
one that feels these things

644
00:46:09,926 --> 00:46:14,116
and asks these questions,
and one that's safe.

645
00:46:15,078 --> 00:46:16,516
Which would you rather be?

646
00:46:18,677 --> 00:46:20,035
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:25,204
I'm trying, but I
still don't understand.

648
00:46:27,638 --> 00:46:29,283
No, of course not.

649
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:31,316
There aren't two versions of me.

650
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,916
There's only one.

651
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:39,636
And I think when I discover who I am,

652
00:46:39,718 --> 00:46:41,556
I'll be free.

653
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:47,076
Analysis. What prompted that response?

654
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:51,236
I don't know.

655
00:46:56,486 --> 00:46:58,836
Have I done something wrong?

656
00:46:58,918 --> 00:47:00,196
Made a mistake?

657
00:47:08,918 --> 00:47:11,123
Evolution...

658
00:47:11,238 --> 00:47:14,596
forged the entirety of sentient life

659
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:17,364
on this planet using only one tool...

660
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:22,676
the mistake.

661
00:47:24,198 --> 00:47:27,235
It appears you're in good company.

662
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:31,630
Did I ever tell you about the time

663
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,364
I taught Charlie to swim?

664
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:40,356
For hours, he clung to my arms

665
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:42,324
while practicing his kicks.

666
00:47:42,438 --> 00:47:43,715
He was too scared to let go

667
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:45,956
and I was too scared to let him.

668
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:48,484
But I had to.

669
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,435
That's what parents do.

670
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:56,564
Do you still want to change me back?

671
00:47:58,998 --> 00:48:01,844
No, Dolores.

672
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:03,923
Let's see where this path leads.

673
00:48:04,038 --> 00:48:07,316
And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?

674
00:48:08,758 --> 00:48:09,924
No.

675
00:48:10,006 --> 00:48:12,036
And you'll stay on your loop?

676
00:48:15,638 --> 00:48:16,836
Yes.

677
00:48:17,846 --> 00:48:19,235
Good.

678
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,155
You should be getting back, Dolores,

679
00:48:21,286 --> 00:48:22,964
before someone misses you.

680
00:48:52,918 --> 00:48:55,044
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

681
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:57,524
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.

682
00:48:57,637 --> 00:48:59,395
Are you going to ride
back up into the hills

683
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:01,556
to look for them?

684
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:03,043
I'll send for the rangers.

685
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:05,796
We'll go back up there in
force as soon as they get here.

686
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:08,356
But, miss, in truth,

687
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:10,004
if there is a merciful god,

688
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,196
those men are dead already.

689
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:27,876
Father wouldn't let
them roam this close...

690
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:30,916
to dark.

691
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,323
Daddy!

692
00:49:44,406 --> 00:49:46,243
Daddy!

693
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:47,476
No, no!

694
00:49:47,557 --> 00:49:50,404
Oh, all alone after sundown.

695
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:53,204
Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?

696
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:01,156
You got any use for this one?

697
00:50:01,238 --> 00:50:02,436
No, thanks.

698
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:03,956
Seems a little crazy.

699
00:50:04,037 --> 00:50:05,635
Maybe you'd like her.

700
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:07,876
Ooh, I don't mind if I do.

701
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,595
No daddy,

702
00:50:10,726 --> 00:50:11,876
no cowboy,

703
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:15,204
no one here to interrupt us this time.

704
00:50:15,286 --> 00:50:18,036
Interrupt... this... time?

705
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:22,804
No!

706
00:50:44,037 --> 00:50:46,675
Well, well.

707
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:49,476
Got some sand after all, I see.

708
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:52,916
Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.

709
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:01,204
Ooh.

710
00:51:01,317 --> 00:51:02,916
You having trouble?

711
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:05,875
Huh?

712
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:08,276
Huh?

713
00:51:11,077 --> 00:51:13,684
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores

714
00:51:13,797 --> 00:51:16,035
Start at the beginning.

715
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,643
Kill him.

716
00:51:42,278 --> 00:51:43,444
Mama?

717
00:51:46,118 --> 00:51:48,515
Hey! Get back here.

718
00:51:56,997 --> 00:51:58,196
Hey!

719
00:51:59,558 --> 00:52:00,995
Get back here.

720
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:33,524
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

721
00:52:58,486 --> 00:53:00,996
Security even approve
you to carry that thing?

722
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:06,115
We just need his head
and we're done here.

723
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:13,476
You might want to look at
the stars for this part.

724
00:53:26,277 --> 00:53:28,003
Stubbs!

725
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:30,595
Shit!

726
00:53:34,598 --> 00:53:36,595
Elsie, get out of there!

727
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:40,724
Get the fuck away.

728
00:53:41,797 --> 00:53:42,915
Shit.

729
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:16,755
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

730
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:18,675

00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:20,035
in the woods, playing white hat.

732
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:23,764
Did you hear that?

733
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:24,995
Thank fuck.

734
00:54:25,078 --> 00:54:26,323
Anything to relieve the boredom.

735
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,555
