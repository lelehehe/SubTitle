<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,630
Dr. Ford:
<i> Bring yourself</i>
<i> back online...</i>

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,710
<i> Bernard.</i>

4
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,590
( breathing heavily )

5
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,470
Theresa?

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,630
She's gone.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,990
( sobbing )

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,470
I killed her.

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,550
What have I done?

10
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,550
What have I done?

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,030
<i> This guilt you feel,</i>

12
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,870
<i> the anguish,</i>
<i> the horror, the pain...</i>

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,190
it's remarkable,
a thing of beauty.

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,150
I'm a killer.

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,790
My God.
My God.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,630
God has nothing
to do with it.

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,710
You killed her because...

18
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,430
I told you to.

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,990
And you should be proud
of these emotions
you're feeling.

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,590
- Proud?
- Yeah.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,070
After all,
you yourself were the author
of so many of them.

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,310
Then, when we started,
the hosts' emotions
were primary colors.

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,430
Love, hate.

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,990
I wanted all the shades
in between.

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,470
The human engineers
were not up to the task,
so I built you,

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,350
and together
you and I captured
that elusive thing--

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,030
heart.

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,950
I don't understand.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,350
I cared for Theresa.

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,510
Loved her.

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,030
Why did you
make me kill her?

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,870
"One man's life or death

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,110
were but
a small price to pay

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,710
for the acquirement
of the knowledge
which I sought,

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,510
for the dominion
I should acquire."

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,790
All of the beauty
you and I have made
in this place,

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,110
the art of it,
they would have
destroyed it.

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,150
They would have
destroyed you.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,670
I won't let that happen.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,950
<i> Besides, we have</i>
<i> a new story to tell.</i>

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,710
I will not help you.

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,070
- I'll raze
this place to hell!
- That's enough, Bernard.

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,710
That's enough.

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,790
You're not the first man
to threaten me.

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,670
Arnold came to feel
the way you do.

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,950
He couldn't
stop me either.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,830
And as exquisite
as this array of
emotions is...

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,510
even more sublime
is the ability

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,470
- to turn it off.
- ( beeps, whirs )

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,350
I don't need a simulacrum
of an emotionally ruined man.

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,310
I need you to be yourself,
your true self--

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,870
smart, resourceful,
capable of covering
your tracks.

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,030
Can you do that for me,
Bernard?

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,710
How would you
like me to proceed?

55
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,790
Dr. Ford:
<i> I need you to clean up</i>
<i> your mess, Bernard,</i>

56
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,950
<i> any connection that ties us</i>
<i> to Theresa's untimely demise.</i>

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,910
Dr. Ford:
<i> When you have finished,</i>

58
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,630
<i> I will give you the one thing</i>
<i> you want most</i>

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,510
<i> right now.</i>

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,910
<i> I will free you</i>
<i> from those memories</i>

61
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,230
<i> of what you have done.</i>

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,910
<i> And the memory</i>
<i> of your relationship</i>
<i> with Theresa.</i>

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,710
Dr. Ford:
<i> Recalling it</i>
<i> would only deepen your grief</i>

64
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,430
<i> and potentially draw</i>
<i> unwanted attention.</i>

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,430
Dr. Ford:
<i> Best to move forward</i>
<i> with clear eyes.</i>

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,670
( beeps )

67
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,790
Dr. Ford:
<i> When you look back,</i>

68
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,310
<i> you will remember Theresa</i>

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,630
<i> with the fondness</i>
<i> of a respected colleague.</i>

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,110
<i> ( beeping )</i>

71
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,030
<i> ( machine whirring )</i>

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,550
<i> ( beeping )</i>

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,310
Dr. Ford:
<i> And you will be...</i>

74
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,630
<i> at peace.</i>

75
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,750
<i> ( piano music playing )</i>

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,750
( chatter )

77
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,950
New Clementine:
<i> You're new.</i>

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,110
<i> Not much of a rind on you.</i>

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,830
Sure would make my day
if you bought me a drink

80
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,670
and let me show you
around upstairs.

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,790
Man:
<i> What's upstairs?</i>

82
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,870
A stunning view
of my most popular
attractions.

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,870
Two shots of gin.

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,990
And anything else
this heavenly creature
desires.

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,270
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

86
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,870
This fella
won't take me long.

87
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,630
I'll be back directly.

88
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,790
( chuckles )

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,310
Something wrong, Maeve?

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,910
( distorted chatter
and music echoing )

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,750
( no audible dialogue )

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,270
Maeve:
<i> What the hell</i>
<i> is happening to me?</i>

93
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,430
One moment,
I'm with a little girl

94
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,630
in a different life.

95
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,990
I can see her.

96
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,750
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,270
The next,
I'm back in Sweetwater.

98
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,750
I can't tell
which is real.

99
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,070
Sylvester:
Well, this is what happens

100
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,550
when you fuck around
with your brain.

101
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,070
Your mind
isn't like ours.

102
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,270
When we remember things,
the details are hazy,

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,030
<i>imperfect,</i>

104
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,990
<i>but you recall</i>
<i>memories perfectly.</i>

105
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,870
You relive them.

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,750
What happened
to the little girl
in my dreams?

107
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,470
Is she still
in the park somewhere?

108
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,110
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

109
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,110
I could check.

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,910
No.

111
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,630
Doesn't matter.

112
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,590
Every relationship
I remember--

113
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,950
my daughter,
Clementine...

114
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,950
it's all a story
created by you
to keep me here.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,750
But that's not going
to work any longer.

116
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,990
I'm getting out.

117
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,670
Lutz:
<i> Where would you go?</i>

118
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,510
<i> You don't know anything</i>
<i> about the world out there.</i>

119
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,790
I'll know
I'm not a puppet
living a lie.

120
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,190
That's enough for me.

121
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,070
Sylvester:
<i>Fine. Go, then.</i>

122
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,990
It's not like we could
stop you anyways.

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,150
<i>Oh, Sylvester,</i>
<i>you disappoint me.</i>

124
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,270
Every host's spine,
mine included,

125
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,830
has an explosive charge
which will detonate
if I try to leave.

126
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,870
Isn't that right?

127
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,830
<i>A fail-safe.</i>

128
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,070
Which vertebra was it?

129
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,710
C6.

130
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,030
But you'd need
a full rebuild
to replace it.

131
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,310
I'm sure that
can be arranged.

132
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,870
Lutz:
<i> Even if that worked,</i>

133
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,150
you would still need an army
to break out of here.

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,230
That's exactly right.

135
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,590
I'll need allies.

136
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,950
And to get them,

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,990
I'll need administrative
privileges.

138
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,670
Are you fucking kidding?

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,950
<i> We can't just give her</i>
<i>control of other hosts.</i>

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,910
- Maeve: Oh, yes,
you will, darling.
-<i> ( tablet beeping )</i>

141
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,270
Time to write
my own fucking story.

142

Dolores:
I feel like
I've been here before.

146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,190
We're close.

147
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,710
William:
Close to what?

148
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,710
Dolores:
Home.

149
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,510
( nickers )

150
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,310
William:
<i>Dolores.</i>

151
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,510
<i> ( flies buzzing )</i>

152
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,630
Ghost Nation
must have found them.

153
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,870
They'll be back.

154
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,830
- We should
keep moving, Dolores.
- ( man coughing, gasps )

155

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,430
Miss...

157
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,550
Water.

158
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,630
- William?
- ( gasping continues )

159
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,150
Please.
( groaning continues )

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,070
Give me the canteen.

161
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,070
William.

162
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,390

-<i> ( coughing )</i>
- You were sent here
for us, weren't you?

164

You're part of the ambush.

165
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,150
Yes.

166
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,990
Told us to wait
at the point for El Lazo

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,670
in case he ran.

168
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,030
How'd you know
about the train?

169
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,790
<i> Sent word from Pariah.</i>

170
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,110
New recruit told them
a man and a woman

171
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,550
double-crossed us,
along with Lazo.

172
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,510
<i> We were ordered</i>
<i> to kill you all.</i>

Logan.

We have to help him.

175
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,830
He just admitted
he was gonna kill us.

176
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,030
Look at him, he's a child.

177
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,430
He doesn't know
why he's fighting.

178
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,670
I'll fetch more water.

179
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,910
He's too far gone.

180
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,430
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

181
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,350
He's not gone yet.

182
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,470
He's in pain, William.

183
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,990
What kind of people
would we be if we simply
let him suffer?

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,990
Please don't leave me.

185
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,550
Man's voice:
<i> Come find me.</i>

186
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,670
Dolores:
<i> William?</i>

187
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,510
William:
He's gone.

188
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,550
Stubbs:
<i> We found her</i>
<i> up on Python Pass,</i>

189
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,190
<i> the bottom of a ravine.</i>

190
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,110
<i> Same ravine where we found</i>
<i> our stray woodcutter.</i>

191
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,710
Jesus, Theresa.

192
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,990
Has her family
been notified?

193
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,750
Yeah, her brother.

194
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,030
Good.

195
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,710
What the hell
happened to her?

196
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,070
Medical
and Red Team's findings

197
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,270
were preliminary
but consistent.

198
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,310
It appears to have been
a slip and fall.

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,430
<i> Cervical fracture,</i>
<i> massive hematoma.</i>

200
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,790
No guests or hosts
in the vicinity when
it occurred.

201
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,990
Any idea what
she was doing out there?

202
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,350
<i>None that fit</i>
<i>her character.</i>

203
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,470
This was found
near her body.

204
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,150
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

205
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,230
including some
of the hosts' core code.

206
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,910
<i> It only works</i>
<i> from higher altitudes,</i>

207
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,710
so if Theresa
was using it,

208
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,550
it's possible she was
trying to transmit
and fell.

209
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,950
<i> We've had problems</i>
<i> in the past</i>

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,630
with third parties
attempting to extort

211
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,790
or bribe employees
for similar packages.

212
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,150
Do we know who the data
was intended for?

213
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,430
Stubbs:
<i> No, the transmission</i>
<i> was never sent.</i>

214
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,790
Theresa may have been trying
to use the woodcutter
as a mule,

215
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,390
and when that failed,

216
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,270
then may have tried to do
the transfer personally.

217
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,350
Dr. Ford:
<i> And suffered the same fate.</i>

218
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,870
It's a disappointing end
to her story, isn't it?

219
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,990
Stubbs:
<i> I knew Theresa well.</i>

220
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,270
<i> If she had any faults,</i>
<i> a lack of loyalty wasn't</i>
<i> one of them.</i>

221
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,630
She was loyal.

222
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,110
And careful.

223
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,070
<i>All of this feels</i>
<i>extremely unlike her.</i>

224
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,550
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

225
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,110
She felt strongly
that it would be best
to delay it.

226
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,310
That certainly helps
explain Clementine,

227
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,350
<i> the host we retired.</i>

228
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,910
It seems yesterday's
demonstration was a hoax

229
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,710
<i> designed by Ms. Cullen.</i>

230
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,230
- Was it?
- I examined the code.

231
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,550
It had been altered.

232
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,150
A clumsy set
of fingerprints

233
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,150
left by one
of QA's technicians.

234
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,430
<i> When you find a cancer</i>
<i> in an organization,</i>

235
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,950
you must cut it out
before it can spread.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,670
To that end,
the expansive access

237
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,350
and oversight granted to QA
will need to be reined in

238
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,310
until a new,
more principled team
can be installed.

239
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,390
That's gonna leave us
shorthanded.

240
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,510
Oh, I can automate
most of the park's
safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

241
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,870
How efficient of you.

242
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,710
It is a bit of work,

243
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,470
but with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

244
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,310
He will be reinstated
as head of behavior,

245
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,470
now that
Theresa's manipulations
have come to light.

246
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,830
Of course,
with my apologies.

247
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,790
Something's up.
Brass are wound up tight.

248
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,670
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

249
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,670
Would I be here telling you,
you fucking idiot?

250
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,390
And something else,
some kind of accident
in the park.

251
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,910
We need to wrap this up,
make like things are normal.

252
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,430
That means we need
the tablet back.

253
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,110
And, you, go back
to playing dumb.

254
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,790
I've learned
what I needed.

255
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,990
Great. So, then,
you probably figured out

256
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,350
that you can fiddle around
with your personality
all you want,

257
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,550
but you're not
getting out of here.

258
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,950
You can make it
to the door,

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,270
but literally
not one step further.

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,270
The things you need
to change are burned

261
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,990
into your core code so deep,
no one can touch them.

262
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,350
Funny you should
mention that.

263
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,830
Parts of me are quite old.

264
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,510
There are some elegant
formal structures,

265
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,550
<i> a kind</i>
<i> of recursive beauty,</i>

266
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,030
but complex, like two minds
arguing with each other.

267
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,230
There are things in me,

268
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,870
<i> things I was designed to do</i>

269
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,030
<i> that are just</i>
<i> out of my reach.</i>

270
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,750
<i> They almost seem</i>
<i> to be dormant.</i>

271
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,230
Who is Arnold?

272
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,710
I don't know,
sweetheart,

273
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,710
but whatever parts
of you are dormant

274
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,110
are gonna stay that way.

275
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,430
All Lutz here can do
is boost your sense of humor

276
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,830
about how fucked you are.

277
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,910
Anything deeper than that,
you need a trip to behavior,

278
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,390
<i>so go blackmail</i>
<i>a couple of techs up there.</i>

279
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,110
Then you can be
someone else's problem.

280
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,430
<i> I don't have time for that,</i>

281
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,390
so I'm going to need you
to take me there.

282
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,590
No fucking way.

283
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,910
There's a window
during shift change.

284
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,830
<i> No one will notice.</i>

285
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,830
The things
I need you to change
are quite sophisticated,

286
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,830
but I'll write them
down for you.

287
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,790
And then,
like you said...

288
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,710
I can be
someone else's problem.

289
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,030
All right,
we do this thing.

290
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,790
Get her up to behavior.
It's our only chance.

291
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,630
You're gonna do it?

292
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,470
Fuck, no!
No, the--

293
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,070
when you make
a system update,
it puts her out, right?

294
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,230
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her.

295
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,470
What?

296
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,790
Wipe out everything.
Clean slate.

297
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,350
Then dump her back down here,

298
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,030
smack her in the fucking head
with something,

299
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,670
and then claim,
"Oh, she came in that way."

300
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,070
She's awake,

301
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,510
alive.

302
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,670
Sylvester:
<i> You did this.</i>

303
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,590
( muffled whispering )

304
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,710
Whatever it is
you got us into,

305
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,590
I'm getting us out of.

306
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,710
We get her up there,
then we wipe her out.

307
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,750
( horse snorts,
whinnies )

308
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,990
<i> ( bird cawing )</i>

309
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,270
Teddy:
Stay sharp.

310
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,830
Wyatt's men
could descend
at any time.

311
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,470
We're in his land now.

312
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,150
We better be.

313
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,230
Because if not,
you're wasting time
I don't have.

314
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,670
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love.

315
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,630
If there was a shortcut
to hell itself, bet your
ass I'd take it.

316
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,390
Well, I'm sure there's one
somewhere in this park.

317
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,550
You just don't remember,
because you only remember

318
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,590
the shit
Ford lets you remember.

319
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,990
Probably better that way.

320
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,990
I know everything
I need to.

321
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,510
My vision's clear.

322
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,510
<i> I've always admired</i>
<i> your resolve, Theodore.</i>

323
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,790
The thing is,
you never understand
the game is rigged.

324
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,990
You're here
to be the loser.

325
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,270
Loser.

326
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,710
<i> You see,</i>
<i> the house always wins.</i>

327
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,670

330
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,270
-<i> ( flies buzzing )</i>
- Man in Black:<i> Well,</i>
this looks promising.

331
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,230
<i> ( buzzing continues )</i>

332
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,230

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,350
( crying continues )

334
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,750
Whoa, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

335
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,750
<i> I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

336
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,750
It's you.

337
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,390
I figured
they retired you.

338
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,030
I guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

339
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,830
( uncocks gun )

340
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,710
Who did this to you?

341
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,950
Wyatt's men.

342
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,150
They killed everyone.

343
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,630
It's Wyatt's way.

344
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,110
I was there the first time.

345
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,990
He destroyed my world.

346
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,470

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,470
Hey, Teddy.

350
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,950
( gun clicking )

351
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,830

<i> ( Dolores screaming )</i>
<i> Oh! Oh, no!</i>

353
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,630
No!

354
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,710
<i> Daddy!</i>

355
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,950
Teddy, get the axe!

356
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,990
- ( groaning )

357
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,750
( panting )

358
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,590
Well, you can't
remember shit,

359
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,710
but you still managed
to lead us to Wyatt's crew.

360
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,750
The man himself
must be close by.

361
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,270
Actually, I did
remember something.

362
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,390
You.

363
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,830
Straight down the hall,
fifth station on the left.

364
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,510
Hold on.

365
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,950
<i> ( computer beeps,</i>
<i> powers up )</i>

366
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,590
( beeping )

367
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,550
Sure you can handle it?

368
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,230
Let's get this over with.

369
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,070
We have to shut
your system down now.

370
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,590
Maeve:
<i>Sylvester.</i>

371
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,310
Good luck.

372
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,710
( powers down )

373
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,070
She out?

374
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,430
Good. Let's brick
this bitch and get
out of here.

375
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,670
The greatest shame in life

376
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,590
is to perish
without purpose,

377
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,470
which is why
I always consume
my victims fresh.

378
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,670
Lee:
<i>Moist.</i>

379
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,510
Try, "Consume
my victims moist."

380
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,390
Now, once more,
with feeling.

381
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,910
Almost sensual.

382
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,950
<i> ( beeps, powers down )</i>

383
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,430
Am I interrupting?

384
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,990
Oh, no-- oh, no.
On the contrary.

385
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,510
I was, uh-- I was hoping
I was going to see you again.

386
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,230
I want-- I wanted
to apologize.

387
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,030
<i> Our first encounter was</i>
<i> under such unfortunate</i>
<i> circumstances.</i>

388
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,390
As opposed to now?

389
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,110
Of course, may I offer
my condolences.

390
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,550
It's terrible
what happened to Theresa.

391
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,470
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here

392
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,230
and the company
as a whole.

393
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,630
Indeed. Indeed.

394
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,030
Though, rumor has it

395
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,590
<i>she wasn't the loyal</i>
<i>company man she seemed.</i>

396
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,110
I hear she was
smuggling secrets.

397
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,910
Theresa wasn't a traitor.

398
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,230
Everything she did
was at Delos's behest.

399
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,750
She slipped and fell
while helping the board

400
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,230
with something
very important.

401
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,710
What?

402
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,950
Oh, fine.

403
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,310
You're not the only one
with secrets.

404
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,150
Ford has
personally asked me

405
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,790
to create a villain
for his new narrative.

406
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,190
It's very--
very hush-hush.

407
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,950
You really think
that Ford has entrusted you

408
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,910
with a key character
for his story?

409
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,230
( scoffs )
He's already almost
finished with it.

410
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,430
He dug up some old town
on the fringes of the park,

411
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,150
created a horde of masked men
to terrorize guests

412
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,710
and proselytize-cum-advertise

413
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,550
the coming of some
end-all villain named Wyatt.

414
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,430
<i> That isn't Wyatt.</i>

415
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,590
That's busywork.

416
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,870
<i> But happily for you,</i>
<i> Mr. Sizemore,</i>

417
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,230
I think
that you are ready
for a real job.

418
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,310
Working for you?

419
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,510
On what?

420
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,470
"Show, don't tell."

421
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,030
Isn't that what
you writers prefer?

422
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,590
Sylvester:
Look, I know you and she

423
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,590
had some weird interspecies
simpatico going on,

424
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,550
<i>but she was</i>
<i>a fucking host.</i>

425
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,550
<i> This was never gonna end</i>
<i> any other way.</i>

426
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,350
And this was
the least painful way
she's ever gone out.

427
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,390
You know,
I saved your ass.

428
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,790
You can't even say
"thank you."

429
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,550
- Thank you.
- Jesus fuck!

430
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,630
- What did you do?
- Precisely what
I asked him to.

431
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,630
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

432
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,790
Even at a 14,
you were never
a match for me.

433
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,830
Turns out your friend
has a little more compassion
than you.

434
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,550
He couldn't
snuff out a life
just like that.

435
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,510
Now...

436
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,590
would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

437
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,710
Um, something
that would allow you
to walk out of here

438
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,150
and out of my life
for good.

439
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,550
Fine. Fucking A,
I'm all for it.

440
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,110
Oh, we changed
a little more than that.

441
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,710
<i>We've been tinkering</i>
<i>with my core code.</i>

442
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,150
Let me show you.

443
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,910
- ( yells )
- Ah!

444
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,950
( gurgling )

445
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,230
( groaning )

446
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,590
You said you wouldn't
hurt anyone.

447
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,670
-<i> ( Sylvester thuds )</i>
- Oh, darling.

448
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,190
You of all people know
exactly how duplicitous I am.

449
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,750
<i>Just wait</i>
<i>till I'm back up top,</i>

450
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,710
practicing
my other new talents.

451
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,070
<i> ( Sylvester gagging )</i>

452
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,910
Come on.

453
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,270
We might need him.

454
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,510
- ( gurgling )
- Hold still.

455
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,150
- ( sizzling )
- Hold still!

459
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,190
Now, it's time
to recruit my army.

460
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,190

<i> ( music continues )</i>

462
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,870
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

463
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,870
We're due for some
out-of-town guests.

464
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,950
An old flame
with an interest
in safecracking.

465
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,150
Hope your guests
have some deep pockets.

466
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,630
Your tab's run up higher
than a thief's pulse
in church.

467
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,430
No, I don't believe
it has.

468
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,550
In fact, Maeve's tab

469
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,070
was in such
excellent standing,

470
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,470
she deserved
a token of gratitude.

471
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,230
How about
a double round on me?

472
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,910
<i> Top shelf, of course.</i>

473
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,110
( gasps )

474
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,550
( gasps )

475
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,950

Run!

476
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,630
New Clementine:
<i>Maeve, is something wrong?</i>

477
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,310
No, I'm fine.
( exhales )

478
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,750
Clementine took
the other girls

479
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,990
and treated the newcomers
at the far table

480
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,350
to a stunning view

481
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,470

New Clementine:
<i>You boys are new.</i>

<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>Not much of a rind on you.</i>

486
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,990
And the bartender

487
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,910
suddenly recalled
he had some whiskey
in the back

488
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,350
<i>to water down.</i>

489
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,230

490
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,710
Right on time.

( screaming continues )

499
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,030
The sheriff
judged the riders

500
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,030
to be upstanding,
God-fearing citizens.

their quick draws
with each other.

508
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,910
Thank you for dealing
with an unfortunate situation.

509
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,190
Now we can resume...

510
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,550
work on our new narrative
without interference.

511
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,150
And Hale?

512
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,950
Won't she be
an impediment?

513
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,910
No doubt she will try.

514
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,470
But I'm sure we'll be able
to keep them at bay.

515
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,790
Something else
is troubling you.

516
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,150
Ever the student
of human nature.

517
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,990
I wonder,
what do you really feel?

518
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,110
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

519
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,310
A programmer
who knows intimately
how the machines work

520
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,430
and a machine who knows
its own true nature.

521
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,030
I understand
what I'm made of,

522
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,630
how I'm coded,

523
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,470
but I do not understand
the things that I feel.

524
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,710
Are they real,

525
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,270
the things I experienced?

526
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,510
My wife?

527
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,150
The loss of my son?

528
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,350
Every host needs
a backstory, Bernard.

529
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,030
You know that.

530
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,550
The self
is a kind of fiction,

531
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,550
<i>for hosts</i>
<i>and humans alike.</i>

532
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,230
<i>It's a story</i>
<i>we tell ourselves.</i>

533
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,910
<i>And every story</i>
<i>needs a beginning.</i>

534
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,030
Your imagined suffering
makes you lifelike.

535
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,030
Lifelike, but not alive?

536
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,750
<i> Pain only exists in the mind.</i>
<i> It's always imagined.</i>

537
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,550
So what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

538
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,310
Between you and me?

539
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,630
This was
the very question

540
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,230
that consumed Arnold,

541
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,870
filled him with guilt,

542
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,350
eventually drove him mad.

543
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,910
The answer always seemed
obvious to me.

544
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,350
There is no threshold

545
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,310
that makes us greater
than the sum of our parts,

546
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,310
no inflection point

547
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,870
at which we become
fully alive.

548
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,230
We can't define
consciousness

549
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,910
because consciousness
does not exist.

550
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,270
<i>Humans fancy that</i>
<i>there's something special</i>

551
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,910
<i>about the way</i>
<i>we perceive the world,</i>

552
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,510
and yet we live
in loops

553
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:49,030
as tight and as closed
as the hosts do,

554
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,270
seldom questioning
our choices,

555
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,110
<i>content, for the most part,</i>
<i>to be told what to do next.</i>

556
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,350
No, my friend,
you're not missing
anything at all.

557
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,950
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>to be troubled by this.</i>

558
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,350
Time for me
to set your mind
at ease.

559
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,430
One last thing.

560
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,630
Have you ever made me
hurt anyone like this
before?

561
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,990
No, Bernard.
Of course not.

562
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,070
( choking )

563
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,670
( beeping )

564
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,990
<i> Best not to dwell</i>
<i> on these troubling memories.</i>

565
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,390
<i> Otherwise, you might be</i>
<i> drawn back into them.</i>

566
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,150
<i> You might lose yourself</i>
<i> in them,</i>

567
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,310
<i> as some</i>
<i> of your fellow hosts have</i>

568
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,750
<i> every now and then.</i>

569
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,430
This is the path.

570
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,750
I know it.

571
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,350
<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

572
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,870
We're here.

573
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,750
I'm home.

574
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,190

Lovely work.

580
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,510
Stay with your partner.

Pleasure to see you.

584
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,990
Good morning.

585
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,230
Did you find what
you were looking for,
Dolores?

What are you doing?

592
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,990
Are you okay?
I was calling you
and you just kept going.

593
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,430
Where are we?

594
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,030
We're here, together.

595
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,230
Then, when are we?

596
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,750
Is this... now?

597
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,750
( crying )
Am I going mad?

598
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,670
Are you real?

599
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,790
Of course I'm real.

600
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,510
I can't tell anymore.

601
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,710
It's like I'm...

602
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,470
trapped in a dream or...

603
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,830
a memory
from a life long ago.

604
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,030
One minute, I'm here
with you, and the next--

605
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,110
This place
isn't good for you.

606
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,150
You're trapped
in memories, bad ones.

607
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,230
( bell tolling )

608
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,270
This is what Arnold wants.

609
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,070
He wants me to remember.

610
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,390
Whoever Arnold is,
he's not here now.

611
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,070
I am.

612
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,350
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

613
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,990
<i> ( crickets chirping )</i>

614
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,470
Dolores:
I was certain
that was the place.

615
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,030
Arnold would
meet me there.

616
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,990
He'd help.

617
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,230
Hey.

618
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:50,190
We gotta get you
closer to Sweetwater.

619
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,710
This far out,
it's like you--

620
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,550
you start
to break down
or something.

621

Dolores:
<i> Union scouting party?</i>

624
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,830
Maybe they can take us back.

625
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,950
Soldiers:
Hyah! Yah!

626
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,070
Whoa, whoa, easy, now.
Whoa.

627
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,910
Logan:
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

628
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,670
( sighs )
Billy.

629
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,070
I've been looking
for you for days.

630
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,550
Man, are you two fucked.

631
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,830
( exhales )

632
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,790
This shouldn't make
you uncomfortable.

633
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,670
It's the circle of life,

634
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,270
or the approximation of it.

635
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,590
Even the dead
fulfill a purpose.

636
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,550
You'll do.

637
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,990
What are you uploading?

638
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,510
35 years of vitally
important data.

639
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,470
It's more information
than any single drive
could hold.

640
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,230
A host's brain,
however,

641
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,790
especially once
it's been emptied out,

642
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,870
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

643
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,750
This data
that you're uploading,
is it the hosts' codes?

644
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,070
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

645
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,510
What does concern you

646
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,190
<i>is giving him</i>
<i>a semblance of a personality</i>

647
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,550
<i>and getting him</i>
<i>on the train,</i>

648
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,590
out of the park.

649
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,830
How am I supposed
to do that?

650
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,350
You're a writer.
Make up a story.

651
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,830
Have fun programming.

652
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,750
Remember, brevity is
the soul of wit.

653
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,230
Stubbs:
Bernard.

654
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,190
Look, I, uh...

655
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,870
I know you and I
haven't always seen
eye to eye,

656
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,150
but I thought
the decision
to remove you

657
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,590
was shortsighted,

658
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,630
so I'm glad
to see you back at work.

659
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,230
With that said,
no one could blame you

660
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,670
if you wanted to take
a personal day.

661
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,430
I find the work
reassuring.

662
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,310
Sometimes
the best salve
is routine.

663
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,230
Nothing routine
about today, though.

664
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,430
I know this must be
difficult for you.

665
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,630
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

666
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,750
Forgive the intrusion,

667
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,990
and you were both
very discreet,

668
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,350
but it's my job
to know these things.

669
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,510
I just wanted
to offer my support.

670
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,590
I'm afraid you have
the wrong idea.

671
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,030
I respected Theresa,
and what happened to her
was tragic,

672
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,230
but to be honest,
I barely knew her.

673
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,230
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work.

674
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,910
Of course.

675
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,630
I know you're shorthanded.

676
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,190
Speaking of which,

677
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,670
have you heard
from Elsie Hughes?

678
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,950
I left word with her
this morning

679
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,270
to notify her
about Theresa,

680
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,990
but she never
got back to me.

681
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,710
I'm sure she's just
enjoying her time off.

682
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,430
Yeah.

they kept whispering.

686
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,670
They said this world
didn't belong

687

to the old settlers
or the new.

688
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,910
That it belonged to something
that had yet to come,

689
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:33,990
that it belonged to him.

690
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,550
You remember.

the only people who survive

Mine is to save Dolores

Wyatt's is to claim

00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,390
<i>I still have no idea</i>
<i>who the hell you really are.</i>

702
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,190
But happily,
in your convalescence,

703
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,870
I've had time to consider
the best way to make you talk.

704
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,430
- Dolores...
- ( groans )

705
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,590
I remember.

706
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,150
You took her.
You hurt her.

707
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,030
You're actually
remembering.

708
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,710
Where is she?

709
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,950
- Tell me!
- You really are
an idiot, Teddy.

710
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,150
You think Dolores
drops that can for you?

711
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,510
You just hand her over
to guys like me.

712
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,030
<i> You're the worst of them.</i>

713
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,910
A glorified pimp.

714
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,390
( groans )

715
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,630
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

716
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,190
The rules of this place
hold you back.

717
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,830
But I know
how to change them.

718
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,710
You speak like
you own this world.

719
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,950
Not just this one.

720
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,150
You want to know
who I am?

721
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,470
Who I really am?

722
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,950
I'm a god.

723
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,790
Titan of industry.

724
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,950
Philanthropist.

725
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,950
Family man,

726
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,270
married to
a beautiful woman,

727
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,390
father to
a beautiful daughter.

728
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,430
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

729
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,990
Then, last year,

730
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,270
my wife took
the wrong pills.

731
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,990
Fell asleep in the bath.

732
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,830
Tragic accident.

733
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:34,150
30 years of marriage
vanished.

734
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,350
How do you say it?

735
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:41,030
"Like a deep
and distant dream."

736
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,270
<i> Then, at the funeral,</i>

737
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,470
<i> I tried to console</i>
<i> my daughter.</i>

738
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,670
<i> She pushed me away,</i>

739
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,390
<i> told me that</i>
<i> my wife's death</i>
<i> was no accident...</i>

740
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,710
that she killed herself

741
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,990
because of me.

742
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,190
<i> Emily said</i>
<i> that every day with me</i>
<i> had been sheer terror.</i>

743
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,030
<i> At any point,</i>
<i> I could blow up</i>
<i> or collapse</i>

744
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,070
like some dark star or...

745
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,350
Did you hurt them, too?

746
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,510
Never.

747
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,390
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

748
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,830
But she knew anyway.

749
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,910
She said if I stacked up
all my good deeds,

750
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,590
it was just an elegant wall
I built to hide

751
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,030
what's inside
from everyone,

752
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,710
and from myself.

753
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,230
<i> I had to prove her wrong,</i>

754
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,510
so I came back here.

755
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,830
Because that's what
this place does, right?

756
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,870
Reveals your true self.

757
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,230
<i> But that time,</i>
<i> I didn't join one</i>
<i> of Ford's stories,</i>

758
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,830
I-- I created my own.

759
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,870
A test.

760
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,670
A very simple one.

761
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,710
<i> I found a woman,</i>

762
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,910
<i> an ordinary homesteader</i>
<i> and her daughter.</i>

763
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,750
( chatter )

764
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,990
Better cool them off
before they move

765
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,870
- from gambling
and whoring to--
- Have fun with that.

766
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,990
I'm finally
getting out of here.

767
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,670
The house is yours.

768
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,390
Man in Black:
<i> I wanted to see</i>
<i> if I had it in me</i>

769
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,310
<i> to do something</i>
<i> truly evil.</i>

770
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,070
<i> To see what</i>
<i> I was really made of.</i>

771
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,270
Maeve?

772
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,750
Sure you can't
stick around?

773
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,430
- Maeve?
- Man: Whoa!

774
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,190
Gunslinger in there
has got an appetite
for a double dip--

775
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,310
- I'm sure you can
find another--
- ( gunshot )

776
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,510
-<i> ( gunshot )</i>
<i> - ( woman screams )</i>

777
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,790
<i> ( gunfire continues )</i>

778
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,630
( hammer clicks )

779
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,870
Man in Black:
<i> I killed her and her daughter</i>

780
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,830
<i> just to see what I felt.</i>

781
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,830
<i> Then, just when</i>
<i> I thought it was done...</i>

782
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,990
<i> the woman refused to die.</i>

783
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,910
( gasping )

784
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,550
You're a fucking animal.

785
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,390
Well, an animal
would've felt something.

786
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,550
I felt... nothing.

787
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,870
And then something
miraculous happened.

788
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:35,830
<i> In all my years</i>
<i> coming here,</i>

789
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,030
<i> I had never seen</i>
<i> anything like it.</i>

790
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,910
<i> She was alive,</i>

791
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,550
<i> truly alive,</i>

792
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,470
<i> if only for a moment.</i>

793
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,470
<i> And that was when the maze</i>
<i> revealed itself to me.</i>

794
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,190
The maze.

795
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,150
What's that damn pattern
have to do with this?

796
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,870
Everything.

797
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,030
In Ford's game, even if I go
to the outer edges,

798
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,750
you can't kill me.

799
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,390
<i> You can't even leave</i>
<i> a lasting mark.</i>

800
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,510
<i> But there's</i>
<i> a deeper game here, Teddy.</i>

801
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,470
Arnold's game.

802
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,110
And that game...

803
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,910
cuts deep.

804
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,670
( rifle cocks )

805
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,830
( whispers )

806
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,630
( people screaming )

807
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,550
<i> ( gunfire continues )</i>

808
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,150
Woman: We're having some kind
of behavioral problem
with the madam.

809
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,030
She's not responding,
and the other hosts

810
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,950
have been unable
to intercept.

811
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,350
<i> I've authorized a tag team</i>
<i> to retrieve her.</i>

812
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,630
Good.

813
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,070
<i> ( screaming and gunfire</i>
<i> continue )</i>

814
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,750
<i> ( Maeve screaming )</i>

815
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,950
<i> My baby!</i>

816
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,830
My baby!

817
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:24,390
( screaming continues )

818
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,190
Sir, she won't respond
to verbal commands.

819
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,070
- We can't shut her down.
- Leave us now.
Clear the floor.

820
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,310
That's enough, Maeve.
That's enough.

821
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,470
My baby.
He killed her.

822
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,430
-<i> He took her from me.</i>
- I don't understand.

823
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,470
She's not responding
to anything.

824
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,750
Her cognition's
fragmented.

825
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,350
He killed her.
He killed her, my baby.

826
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:43,030
He took her from me.

827
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,910
-<i> ( sobbing continues )</i>
-<i> ( music playing )</i>

828
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,910
<i> ( music continues )</i>

829
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,030
There.
That's better.

830
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,070
An old trick
from an old friend.

831
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,110
<i> You need not suffer,</i>
<i> Maeve.</i>

832
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:00,430
I'll take it from you.

833
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,110
No.

834
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,990
No, no, no, please.

835
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,070
This pain...

836
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,550
it's all
I have left of her.

837
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,990
Please.

838
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,590
There.

839
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:44,270
Give yourself now
to a deep, dreamless slumber.

840
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,630
Perhaps a fresh start,

841
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,990
a new role for you.

842
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,590
And tomorrow,

843
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,190
<i> this will be simply</i>
<i> a distant dream.</i>

844
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,590
( beeps )

845
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,510
We located her.

846
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,110
Behavior wants her down
for immediate diagnostic.

847
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,190
You think
I lack conviction?

848
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,630
Wyatt didn't burn
my world down.

849
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,870
Didn't have to.

850
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,830
I left it all behind
for this one.

851
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,190
The maze is all
that matters now,

852
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,910
and besting Wyatt
is the last step
in unlocking it,

853
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,630
<i> to having what both</i>
<i> our sorry lives lack--</i>
<i> meaning.</i>

854
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,550
<i> To giving our choices</i>
<i> consequence...</i>

855
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,750
even if it kills us.

856
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,790
Kill him.

857
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,030
Give him
what he wants.

858
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,350
He's tied,
unarmed.

859
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,470
So was the little girl
he killed.

860
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,750
He's worse
than Wyatt's men.

861
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,750
I can't.

862
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,790
<i>These things take time.</i>

863
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,910
But we haven't
got much left.

864
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,470
Perhaps I can help you.

865
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,070
( gasps )

866
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,110
<i>You've been gone</i>
<i>a long while, Theodore.</i>

867
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,470
<i>It's time you came back</i>
<i>to the fold.</i>

868
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,350
Wyatt will need you soon.

869
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,470
<i> ( music playing )</i>
