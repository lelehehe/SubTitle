00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,110
( sighs )
Morning, Maeve.

7
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,750
Late night
talking or fucking?

8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,990
You're only getting paid
for the latter.

9
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,870
I get paid

10
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,950
when they're grateful.

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,950
Ain't always about
what's between my legs.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,550
Hmm.

13
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,990
Man:
What are you looking at?

14
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,390
Don't shoot.

15
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,030
Newcomer.

16
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,590
Looks like a rough one.

17
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,950
Give me a bottle.

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,430
Bartender:
<i> You're gonna need</i>

19
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,310
just to scrub
the filth off him.

20
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,790
( chuckles )

21
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,590
Go find a mirror,
finish putting
your face on.

22
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,670
I'll handle this one.

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,230
<i> ( door opens )</i>

24
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,110
Aren't you gonna take
your clothes off?

25
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,790
Well, I would, darling,
but by the time I got
down to my knickers,

26
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,510
I suspect
you'd be done anyway.

27
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,310
( gasps )

28
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,630
That's the spirit.

29
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,350
Such a big man.

30
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,750
So big all over

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,030
except where it counts.

32
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,310
( grunts )

33
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,230
Darling, when I gave you
a turn on the house,

34
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,430
I thought you might give me
something in return.

35
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,190
Anything.

36
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,150
( grunts )

37
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,110
That's it.

38
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,990
Don't be shy.

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,030
( gasps )

40
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,550
( gasps )

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,430
( sighs )
Shit.

42
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,030
Now, then...

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,630
where were we?

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,110
- You show this to anyone?
- Elsie:<i> Who would I show it to?</i>

45
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,510
This wasn't some guest
with a Swiss Army knife.

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,590
This was done
by someone down here.

47
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,430
<i> It did occur to me</i>
<i> that it might be you.</i>

48
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,190
But then I remembered
that you've been here forever,

49
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,510
and if you were
gonna sell us out,

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,550
you would've done that
years ago.

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,670
I appreciate that.

52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,350
So...

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,910
instead of our hosts
going insane,

54
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,030
they are being used
for industrial espionage.

55
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,670
Does that make this a...

56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,870
glass-half-full
or half-empty-type
situation?

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,270
<i> We're engineers.</i>

58
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,950
It means the glass
has been manufactured

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,150
to the wrong specifications.

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,230
( chuckles )

61
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,310
Do we have any idea
what information

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,830
it was transmitting?

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,190
It's smeared
all over a rock
up on Python Pass.

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,790
Best we could do
would be to figure out

65
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,070
who he was transmitting
the information to,

66
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,910
<i>but we'd need the exact time</i>
<i>that he was up there,</i>

67
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,470
and his geocache
was wiped.

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,110
Not all of it.

69
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,430
Our friend
was an early model.

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,310
The old hosts used a legacy
geopositioning system.

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,910
- Huh.
- Like you said,
I've been here forever.

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,870
The information's
still there,

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,270
but the newer system
can't read it.

74
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,910
Meaning
we can't access it?

75
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,550
Meaning in order
to access it,

76
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,910
I'm going to need
to go downstairs.

Project the known data
against the legacy data

85

and look for anomalies.

86
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,270
Start in this area.

87
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,270
Look at that, science.

88
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,430
What time
did it reach the peak?

89
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,590
<i>( computer screeching )</i>

90
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,590

91
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,550
Check these
against the new system.

( screeching )

93
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,390
These are hosts
that aren't registered
with the new system?

98
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,510
So, if we want the canyon
to extend this far,
this has to go.

99
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,270
We can distribute
the population amongst
the neighboring farms

100
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,790
<i> or just decommission them.</i>

101
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,310
No, I think we've been
disruptive enough

102
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,790
for one day.

103
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,670
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,870
I'll find
my own way back.

105
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,270
Okay.

106
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,630
- Carry on.

That look like

Not much to say.

110
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,590
The maze
is an old native myth.

111
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,310
Regale me, Theodore.

112
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,830
The maze itself
is the sum of a man's life--

113
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,230
choices he makes,

114
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,550
dreams he hangs on to.

115
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,550
And there at the center,
there's a legendary man

116
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,390
who had been killed
over and over again
countless times,

117
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,750
<i>but always clawed his way</i>
<i>back to life.</i>

118
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,430
The man returned
for the last time

119
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,670
and vanquished
all his oppressors
in a tireless fury.

120
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,030
He built a house.

121
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,910
Around that house
he built a maze
so complicated,

122
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,510
only he could
navigate through it.

123
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,110
<i>I reckon</i>
<i>he'd seen enough</i>
<i>of fighting.</i>

125

closed the border.

128
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,070
All right, Teddy.

129
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,830
Time for you
to earn your keep.

130
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,670
How else do we get
over the border?

<i> Wyatt's got</i>

133
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,510

<i>Dirty ain't my concern.</i>

138

Now, you do
what suits you.

139
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,470
I'm going all the same.

140
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,190
And I'm gonna find Dolores.

141
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,030
Lutz:
Everything you do,

142
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,710
it's because
the engineers upstairs

143
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,310
programmed you
to do it.

144
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,790
You don't have a choice.

145
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,070
Nobody makes me
do something

146
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,390
I don't want to,
sweetheart.

147
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,910
Yeah, but...

148
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,190
it's part
of your character.

149
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,990
<i> You're hard to get.</i>

150
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,550
Even when you say no
to the guests,

151
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,550
it's because
you were made to.

152
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,110
And you are like them,
not like me?

153
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,950
Right.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,670
Well, I can't exactly
afford to go to the park,

155
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,070
but...

156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,470
yeah, I'm human...

157
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,590
like the guests.

158
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,030
How do you know?

159
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,630
Because I know.

160
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,150
I was born.

161
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,270
You were made.

162
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,230
We feel the same.

163
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,630
We are the same
these days,

164
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,470
for the most part.

165
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,150
One big difference,
though...

166
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,670
the processing power
in here

167
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,270
is way beyond
what we have.

168
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,910
It's got one drawback,
though.

169
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,910
What's that?

170
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,830
You're under our control.

171
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,790
Well, their control.

172
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,350
They can change you
however they like,

173
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,550
make you forget.

174
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,310
I-- well,
I guess not you.

175
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,830
I don't understand
how you're remembering
all of this, or...

176
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,350
how you're
waking yourself up,

177
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,790
but everything in your head,
they put it there.

178
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,870
Bullshit!

179
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,870
- No one knows
what I'm thinking.
-<i> I'll show you.</i>

180
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,870
Give me a sec.

181
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,990
I have to pair it
with you.

182
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,310
Pair what with me?

183
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,950
You can improvise
a little,

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,070
but most of what you say
was designed upstairs,

185
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,550
same as the rest of you.

186
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,790
This is just a cheap trick.

187
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,550
I've run a brothel
for 10 years,

188
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,830
and if there's
one thing I know,

189
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,710
it's when I'm being
fucked with!

190
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,510
This can't possibly--

191
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,390
<i> I can't, can't.</i>

192
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,110
I can't...

193
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,550
( stuttering )

194
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,950
( gasps )

195
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,110
Maeve?

196
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,670
<i> ( beeping )</i>

197
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,350
Maeve?

198
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,270
( knocking )

199
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,590
You have a minute?

200
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,910
Something I need
to talk to you about.

201
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,190
I was just about
to call for you.

202
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,310
Everything okay?

203
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,350
Ford knows about us.

204
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,950
Does it matter?

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,430
We're consenting adults.

206
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,670
Consenting adults
in business departments

207
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,510
that are supposed
to keep each other in check.

208
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,310
Our relationship
will raise questions

209
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,150
for the board
about my objectivity.

210
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,630
( chuckles )
I have never known you
to go easy on my department.

211
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,110
This can't go on, Bernard.

212
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,110
However fun this
little indiscretion was,
it's over.

213
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,630
We're over.

214
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,350
Give me some credit.
I can be impartial.

215
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,190
About your own team,
about Ford?

216
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,670
<i> You must admit,</i>

217
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,150
his leadership has of late
been questionable.

218
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,510
I don't think
he's the problem.

219
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,110
<i> Respectfully,</i>
<i> it's not your job</i>

220
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,070
to diagnose park
safety problems,
it's mine.

221
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,030
<i> So, if there's</i>
<i> nothing else,</i>

222
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,350
<i> we're done.</i>

223
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,350
<i> ( tablet beeping )</i>

224
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,350
( sighs )

225
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,470
( whispers )
Oh, fuck.

226
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,790
Okay.

227
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,190
- ( beeping continues )
- ( gasps )

228
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,350
Fuck.
Come on, come on.

229
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,230
( whirs )

230
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,150
( gasps )
Oh!

231
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,270
- You said upstairs.
- Oh, my God.

232
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,310
Are you okay?

233
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,390
I want to see it.

234
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,790
Upstairs?

235
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,110
No.

236
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,790
No. No, no.

237
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,990
( sighs )

238
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,310
This is so stupid.

239
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,230
( heart beating )

240
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,150
You son of a bitch!

241
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,630
I'll put a bullet
in your head!

242
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,510
Where are we now?

243
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,990
Design.

244
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,550
Can we please
go back now?

245
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,550
I don't want
to get fired.

246
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,870
And you'd get
sent downstairs.

247
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,190
Don't forget that.

248
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,110
Woman's voice:
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

249
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,190
Live without limits.

250
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,910
Maeve?

251
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,590
( gasps )

252
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,910
All right,
let's get you back.

253
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,190
How did you have
my dreams?

254
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,750
Those moving pictures...

255
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,830
- I saw myself.
- With the little girl?

256
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,990
Those weren't dreams.

257
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,710
That was you
in a previous build.

258
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,910
- A previous what?
- Build.

259
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,550
You guys get reassigned
all the time.

260
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,270
<i>You wouldn't remember,</i>
<i>because that life</i>

261
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,030
<i>and those memories</i>
<i>were erased.</i>

262
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,230
I have been
at the Mariposa
for 10 years.

263
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,430
- Before that, I was
in New Orleans. I--
-<i> No.</i>

264
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,670
You've only been
the madam at the Mariposa
for the last year or so.

265
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,190
<i>They don't rewrite you</i>
<i>completely.</i>

266
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,830
<i>I mean, they could,</i>
<i>but it'd be too much work.</i>

267
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,470
<i>Takes thousands of hours</i>
<i>to build your personalities.</i>

268
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,310
Usually, they just
tweak you a little bit,

269
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,950
and drop you
into a new role.

270
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,230
Sylvester:
<i> What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

271
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,750
You dressing her up now?

272
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,910
This becoming like
a fucking hentai thing
with you now?

273
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,470
No, I just...

274
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,190
- I-- I-- I just--
- You're fucking obsessed!

275
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,350
You know,
I didn't turn you in
for your fuck-up before,

276
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,790
'cause we're friends,
but that was obviously
a bad call.

277
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,950
I mean,
next thing I know,

278
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,510
you're gonna be
wearing her dress,

279
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,990
whispering
sweet nothings
in her ear.

280
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,230
Fuck this.

281
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,270
I'm telling QA.

282
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,310
I'm doing this
for your own good.

283
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,550
( gasps )

284
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,270
You're not going
to tell anyone anything.

285
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,910
Fuck!

286
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,390
You can't hurt me
with this.

287
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,870
You can't hurt anyone--
( grunts )

288
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,110
Can't I?

289
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,550
Turns out
your friend here

290
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,990
<i> is a much more</i>
<i> talented young man</i>

291
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,470
<i> than anyone</i>
<i> gave him credit for.</i>

292
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,750
What the fuck did you do?

293
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,310
Calm down, Sylvester.

294
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,230
I know all about you.

295
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,990
I don't need
one of those things to know
what you're thinking,

296
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,270
because I was built

297
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,870
to read people
just by looking at them,

298
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,110
to know what they want
before they do.

299
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,950
And I know that you want
to fuck me over

300
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,630
the first chance you get,
but you shouldn't.

301
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,190
Everyone has something
they want.

302
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,070
I could help you.

303
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,190
- Ah!
- Or I could gut you
like a trout.

304
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,510
But I won't need
to resort to that.

305
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,510
Because despite
what's in here,

306
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,630
we're not so different.

307
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,070
Are we?

308
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,510
<i> ( man speaking Chinese )</i>

309
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,630
Yes, I understand
the urgency.

310
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,070
I'll do what I can.

311
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,670
Female voice:
<i> Terminate external connection?</i>

312
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,150
Yes.

Woman:
<i> Negative 1.5.</i>
<i> Latitude?</i>

314
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,190
Man:
<i> At 2.69 degrees.</i>

315
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,030
Woman:
No, you did not.
What are you talking about?

316
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,590
- Woman #2: Yes, it works.
- Are you serious?

317
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,710
- I'm telling you.
-<i> ( splash )</i>

318
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,230
<i> ( piano music playing )</i>

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,830
- Waiter:<i> Cocktail, sir?</i>
- Man:<i> Yeah.</i>

320
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,230
Waiter:
<i> All right.</i>
<i> Absolutely. Enjoy.</i>

321
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,270
<i> ( explosion booms )</i>

322
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,510
Theresa:
<i>You look well</i>
<i>for someone on sick leave.</i>

323
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,270
Another margarita.

324
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,830
Join me for a round?

325
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,350
Fuck you.

326
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,590
Just the one, then.

327
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,990
Over the last five days,

328
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,670
to make room
for his narrative,

329
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,590
Ford displaced
over 50 hosts.

330
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,510
It's created
continuity holes

331
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,230
in active storylines
all over the park.

332
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,670
I need you to start
plugging them.

333
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,070
Sorry, a man can
only take so much.

334
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,870
Creatively speaking,
I'm flaccid now.

335
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,790
I can't get it up.

336
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,550
I'm sure you'll recover.

337
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,470
Do you have any idea

338
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,750
what went into
those narratives

339
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,470
that he just demolished
overnight?

340
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,790
Now, forget about the months
I spent writing.

341
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,830
I'm talking about
the years of my life

342
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,590
squeezed down
to their essence,

343
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,430
the raw pulp of truth--

344
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,190
my truth in one
transcendent narrative.

345
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,350
Is that where
the "whoroborus" came in?

346
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,590
Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

347
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,670
No, you won't.

348
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,310
You'll drink
your cocktails,

349
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,030
make your idle threats,
and get this out
of your system.

350
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,470
But don't take too long.

351
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,950
If Ford can't pull this off,

352
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,830
the board will be looking
for a replacement.

353
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,950
But they won't be
looking here.

354
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,310
( whinnies, nickers )

355
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,070
Fastest way to get
to Wyatt, you said.

356
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,910
But it doesn't look like
they're letting anyone
pass here either.

357
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,030
Well,
there's fewer soldiers
than Pariah.

358
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,470
<i> We shoot our way through.</i>

359
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,390
<i> That tunnel leads</i>
<i> to the Old Territories.</i>

360
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,510
( chuckles )
My, my, Teddy.

361
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,790
I think Robert gave you
some extra vinegar
back there,

362
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,590
maybe took away
some sense, too.

363
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,790
It doesn't matter
how fast the route is

364
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,790
if you're gonna end up dead
in the middle of it.

365
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,790
I need you...

366
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,550
to find Wyatt.

367
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,430
Man:
<i> Tighten the ranks.</i>

368
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,510
At ease, fellas.

369
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,350
Keep up
the exemplary work.

370
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,310
<i> ( chatter )</i>

371
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,830
Wyatt's handiwork.

372
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,430
Man in Black:
<i> How can you tell?</i>

373
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,430
Straight-up killing
couldn't hold his interest.

374
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,790
Like he wasn't living
up to the full measure
of his calling,

375
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,990
so he worked to get
more creative.

376
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,310
- Ready?
- Teddy:<i> That's Wyatt,</i>
<i> all right.</i>

377
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,390
<i> He's close.</i>

378
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,350
A word of advice--

379
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,870
whatever
your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

380
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,590
They're only
gonna get worse
the further along we go.

381
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,950
Flood?

382
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,590
- Fuck me,
it's Teddy Flood.
- ( hammers click )

383
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,230
You've made
a mistake, soldier,

384
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,070
but it's not too late
for you to keep walking.

385
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,430
All due respect, sir,

386
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,630
that's a face
I'll never forget.

387
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,750
That's the son of a bitch

388
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,510
ambushed our outpost
at Escalante.

389
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,070
You don't know a damn thing
about what went down
in Escalante.

390
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,670
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself.

391
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,750
And I know a thing or two
about what's going down
right now.

392
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,870
Hey!

393
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,150
You trying to get
yourself killed?

394
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,070
Making peace
with past indiscretions.

395
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,550
Go!

396
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,190
I'll hold them off.

397
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,310
( grunting )

398
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,790
Jesus.

399
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,270
Man:
<i> Really? All right.</i>

400
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,110
- Bartender:
What would you like?
- Woman: Water, please.

401
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,870
You look like a woman
who could use a drink.

402
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,710
What's your poison?

403
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,510
I've been here enough
to know that the park

404
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,390
is all the poison
I can handle.

405
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,430
Mm, a repeat visitor.

406
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,670
Traveling solo?

407
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,710
<i> Purist. Getting off</i>
<i> on the undiluted experience.</i>

408
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,590
Your favorite narrative
is-- oh.

409
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,710
"The Final Burial
of Salvation."

410
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,310
How did you know?

411
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,030
Well, it's my business
to read desires

412
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,110
and to satiate them.

413
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,950
I'm-- I'm Lee,
Lee Sizemore.

414
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,870
Head of narrative.

415
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,550
All these fantasies
come from your twisted
little mind, huh?

416
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,710
Well, the good ones do.

417
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,230
( both laugh )

418
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,470
- So, tell me,
Mr. Sizemore...
- Hmm?

419
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,310
...what's
your favorite ride?

420
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,150
Well, I write them,
I don't play them.

421
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,390
Oh, you want others
to indulge,

422
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,710
but you won't do so
yourself?

423
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,070
You're afraid
to lose control.

424
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,230
( chuckles )

425
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,750
Well, maybe--
maybe it's just a product
of my work environment.

426
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,310
We're not exactly
in a culture where
we can just let loose.

427
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,550
I would have thought
the head of narrative
could do whatever he wanted.

428
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,110
( sighs )
My artistic freedom
is constrained,

429
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,070
what, with QA
breathing down my neck

430
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,510
and behavior
programming the damn things
to go off script.

431
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,870
The robots
can go off script?

432
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,470
Just little gestures.

433
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,670
You know, supposedly,
it makes the things
more lifelike,

434
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,990
but, really, it's just
a vanity project

435
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,310
from the megalomaniac
who started this place.

436
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,110
And frankly,
I don't know why

437
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,950
the suits at Delos
put up with it.

438
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,230
Oh.
( snaps fingers )

439
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,510
Sorry, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to
cut you off.

440
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,910
- Do you know who I am?
- I do.

441
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,590
Ms. Cullen told me
to find you and relay
a message.

442
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,550
<i>"'Tortured artist'</i>
<i>only works for artists.</i>

443
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,350
Sober up
and get back to work."

444
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,750
Seems you're busy.

445
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,390
- Look me up later?
- Well, I don't even
know your...

446
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,270
( groans )

447
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,070
Fuck this job.

448
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,230
What you working on?

449
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,750
Nothing of note.
Business as usual.

450
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,590
Keeping up appearances
before we bust this
stray shit wide open?

451
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,670
I'm close to finding
our saboteur.

452
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,390
That tracking
data you gave me--
it's time stamped.

453
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,630
But once
I cross-reference it
with sat tracking,

454
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,710
we're gonna figure out
who programmed him to try
to smuggle out our data.

455
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,590
Excellent.

456
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,870
Look...

457
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,270
when our corporate overlords
realize that we have saved them

458
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,350
from corporate espionage,

459
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,950
they are going
to be grateful.

460
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,230
And I am going to accept
their gratitude

461
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,350
in the form
of a title bump,
a room upgrade,

462
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,350
and unlimited
Mesa Bar access.

463
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,150
Maybe I should request
Theresa's quarters.

464
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,950
You know the first head
to roll for all this
is gonna be hers.

465
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,670
Yeah, don't be
so disappointed for her.

466
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,670
You reap what you sow.

467
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,150
If QA spent less time
treating us like the enemy--

468
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,630
That's a two-way street,
Elsie.

469
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,070
Theresa's just trying
to do her job.

470
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,830
Maybe she should
try harder.

471
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,790
Sure seems like
there's a lot of shit

472
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,590
slipping
through the cracks.

473
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,870
( quiet chatter )

474
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,990
Got it, okay.

475
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,270
Good afternoon.

476
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,390
Good afternoon.

477
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,990
Any progress
on the inquiry I sent?

478
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,870
Yes, Mr. Lowe,
I've got the information
you asked for.

479
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,150
As expected,
there are neither
guests nor hosts

480
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,550
registered in that sector.

481
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,390
As expected?

482
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,990
It's been designated
off-limits

483
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,630
for future narrative
development.

484
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,830
How many techs visited
Sector 17 recently?

485
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,710
Checking.

486
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,750
No one.

487
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,990
( doors hissing )

488
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,990
<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

489
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,230
( door opens )

490
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,710
<i> ( door closes )</i>

491
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,670
Are you Arnold?

492
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,070
Who's Arnold?

493
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,590
And who the hell
are you?

494
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,990
<i>Boy, is this</i>
<i>some friend of yours?</i>

495
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,750
Well, you're trespassing.

496
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:38,950
Freeze motor functions.

497
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,030
- I said freeze
all motor functions.
- Daddy, don't hurt him!

498
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,510
- He's just lost.
- Well, he can be lost
on someone else's property.

499
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,630
Can't you?

500
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,430
That's enough.

501
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,670
As you were.

502
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,950
They don't respond
to voice commands.

503
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,390
They do respond to mine.

504
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,670
Who are they?

505
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,230
Ghosts now.

506
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,630
<i>Survivors</i>
<i>of the wreck of time.</i>

507
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,150
- These are
first generation?
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,910
Come here, boy.

509
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,430
Turn the other cheek.

510
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,430
Dr. Ford:
<i>See, what our newer designs</i>
<i>gained in efficiency,</i>

511
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,270
they lost in grace.

512
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,390
How are they still operating
after all this time?

513
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,470
I maintain them myself.

514
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,670
That's enough, Robert.

515
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,630
These are the only ones
left in the park

516
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,150
that Arnold built himself.

517
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,990
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

518
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,790
That and the obvious.

519
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,470
- ( dog whining )
- Dr. Ford:<i> Hello, Jock.</i>
<i> Good boy.</i>

520
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,390
<i>I told him of a holiday</i>
<i>my family had taken once</i>

521
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,350
out on the seaside
at Pendeen in Cornwall.

522
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,830
My brother and I roamed
the countryside.

523
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,110
It's my only happy memory
of my childhood.

524
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,630
<i> Arnold built them</i>
<i> as a gift.</i>

525
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,710
<i> He said that great artists</i>
<i> always hid themselves</i>

526
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,470
<i> in their work.</i>

527
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,310
Of course,
Arnold's versions

528
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,310
flattered the originals.

529
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,990
<i>I made some adjustments</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

530
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,870
<i>Gave my father,</i>
<i> in particular,</i>

531
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,230
a few of his
original characteristics.

532
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,270
Respectfully, sir,

533
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,870
this sort of thing
troubles me--

534
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,950
unmonitored hosts
in the park.

535
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,590
<i> They only go</i>
<i> where I've let them.</i>

536
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,230
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

537
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,790
I'm sure
you can indulge me

538
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,390
the little connection
with my past.

539
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,950
If you could only see
your son again, Bernard,

540
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,590
wouldn't you want to?

541
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,670
I think I should
be getting back.

542
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,110
Yes.

543
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,990
We'll talk about this
later if you like.

544
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,950
Dr. Ford:
<i>Well, Robert...</i>

545
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,190
tell me
all about your day.

546
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,630
Stubbs:
Keep your eye on Pariah.

547
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,230
We're running close
to capacity tonight.

548
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,270
- Woman:
<i> Oh, my God.</i>
-<i> ( Lee laughs )</i>

549
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,230
Looks like acid rain
on Sweetwater!

550
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,310
<i> Fuck Ford and his new</i>
<i> fucking narrative.</i>

551
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,590
Fuck this stupid
fucking map.

552
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,150
Fuck that teetotaling
Danish bitch.

553
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,190
Are you filing a complaint,
Mr. Sizemore?

554
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,990
I am declaring
that this park
is my stage

555
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,430
and I shall do with it
what I please.

556
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,070
Well, I suppose now
is as good a time as any.

557
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,630
Lee Sizemore,
this is Charlotte Hale,

558
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,790
executive director
of our board.

559
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,350
She's here
on behalf of Delos

560
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,950
to oversee
certain transitions
in our administration.

561
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,710
We've met.

562
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,390
- Oh.
-<i> ( zipper zips )</i>

563
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,510
( clears throat )

564
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,750
<i> ( electronic chirping )</i>

565
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,430
Bernard:
<i> Access host resources logs.</i>

566
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,830
<i> ( computer beeps )</i>

567
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,710
How many first-generation
hosts are there?

568
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,070
Female voice:
<i> 82.</i>

569
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,950
And how many of those
were designed by Arnold?

570
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,790
<i> 47.</i>

571
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,310
List the names
alphabetically

572
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,710
of all first-generation hosts
still in rotation.

573
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,550
( electronic chirping )

574

- Man:<i> Forward!</i>
- ( horse whinnies )

576
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,150
Be smart
about this, fellas.

577
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,110
<i> I understand</i>
<i> the visceral pleasure of</i>
<i> revenge more than most, but...</i>

578
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,630
I'm prepared
to do business, here.

579
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,030
This man
is very valuable to me,
alive and well.

580
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,390
If you don't quiet down,

581
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,670
I'm liable to add you
to the herd.

582
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,150
Along with
your buddy Flood here.

583
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,870
You're a traitorous
son of a bitch

584
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,990
<i> and a coldhearted killer,</i>
<i> Flood.</i>

585
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,710
( rifle cocks, gunshots )

586
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,830
( gasps )

587
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,790
You're right,
I am a killer.

588
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,470
- ( grunts )
- ( groans )

589
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,710
- ( sizzles )
- ( screams )

590
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,590
<i> ( gunshot )</i>

591
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,350
<i> ( gunshots )</i>

592
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,630
Grab a horse.
Let's get the fuck
outta here.

593
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,390
They'll just follow us.

594
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,390
-<i> ( Gatling gun clicking )</i>
-<i> ( man groans )</i>

595
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,190
( flames crackling )

596
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,430
You think
you know someone.

597
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,630
You don't know me
at all.

598
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,310
<i>Let's get our horses</i>
<i>and gear, and move on.</i>

599
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,190
( beeping )

600
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,350
- Elsie?
- I identified the satellite.

601
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,670
- It's one of ours.
-<i> What?</i>

602
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,830
It's a fucking
Delos satellite.

603
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,630
Whatever we're onto
is some heavy shit.

604
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,590
Oh, get this.
That bicameral system
you told me about?

605
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,230
I think that's what they used
to hack the woodcutter.

606
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,310
<i> The voices our hosts</i>
<i> have been hearing?</i>

607
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,910
<i> I think someone's been</i>
<i> broadcasting to them.</i>

608
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,750
We abandoned that system
decades ago.

609
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,550
Yeah, well,
there's still relays
out there in the park,

610
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,230
and it looks like
someone turned one on.

611
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,750
-<i> Where?</i>
- An abandoned theater
in Sector 3.

612
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,030
I'm gonna go find
the transmitter

613
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,790
and figure out
who else accessed it.

614
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,550
-<i> This is so fucked.</i>
- Are you alone?

615
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,110
- Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
-<i> Elsie, be c--</i>

616
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,790
<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

617
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,790
Robert:
<i> Are you lost?</i>

618
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,710
On the contrary.

619
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,230
I thought we could
play catch with Jock.

620
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,550
Did you bring him?

621
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,230
Where is he, boy?

622
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,630
Okay.

623
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,470
I'm an evil genius
hiding a relay.

624
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,030
Where the fuck
do I hide it?

625
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,910
Um...

626
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,310
( thudding )

627
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,230
-<i> ( objects clatter )</i>
- Fuck, yes.

628
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,870
Now let's see
what we can get
out of you.

629
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,110
Access previous users.

630
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,230
Okay.

631
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,310
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

632
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,990
I thought I was clear about
these late-night visits.

633
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,430
That's not why I'm here.

634
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,630
Earlier today,

635
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,390
I found some anomalies
in the park.

636
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,230
Regardless of what's
happening between us,
we need to talk.

637
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,430
<i> ( phone chirping )</i>

638
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,190
This has to do
with the stray?

639
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,990
That's where it started.

640
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,070
But then I stumbled
onto something,

641
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,470
something I think
you should know about.

642
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,430
I've always trusted Ford.

643
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,550
He's a mentor
and a friend.

644
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,710
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

645
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,590
There's something
going on here,

646
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,310
- something with
his old partner, Arnold.
-<i> ( phone chirping )</i>

647
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,470
- Not now, Elsie.
- Don't hang up.

648
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,150
I hit pay dirt.

649
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,030
I found the person
who was smuggling out
our data.

650
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,990
<i> It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

651
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,350
<i>But she's not</i>
<i>our only problem.</i>

652
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,350
There's something
much bigger going on here.

653
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,910
<i> I'm gonna have</i>
<i> to call you back.</i>

654
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,030
So, this is me?

655
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,470
Lutz:
<i>It's your codebase,</i>

656
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,270
<i>all the things</i>
<i>that make you you.</i>

657
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,190
What are these?

658
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,110
Your attribute matrix.

659
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,630
It's your personality
on a 20-point scale.

660
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,750
Like coordination.

661
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,350
You got a five,
you're clumsy as hell,

662
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,390
but a 15 means
you're an athlete.

663
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,350
What other attributes
are there?

664
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,870
Sylvester:
<i>Lots.</i>

665
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,190
Everything.

666
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,270
Empathy, candor, charm.

667
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,510
<i> You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

668
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,310
Don't act so surprised.

669
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:06,350
Then there's courage,
loyalty, both high.

670
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,710
What's this one?

671
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,110
"Bulk apperception"?

672
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,390
Basically
overall intelligence.

673
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,870
- 14?
- 14 is as high
as they'll let any hosts go.

674
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,270
You're in a management
position.

675
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,710
They want you
to be smart.

676
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,990
But not too smart.

677
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,670
You run a whorehouse,

678
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,830
not an orbital
launch facility.

679
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,310
Fine.

680
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,270
I'd like to make
some changes.

681
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,230
We can't do that.

682
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,430
You'd need a, ahem,
behavior login.

683
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,870
And even then,

684
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,790
any changes we'd make

685
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,950
would just get
auto-flagged, so...

686
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,710
That's not what
your friend here tells me.

687
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,470
<i> He says you can do</i>
<i> exactly that--</i>

688
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,390
<i> activate hosts</i>
<i> and then erase their memory,</i>

689
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,070
<i> all without anyone knowing.</i>

690
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,430
Took me all of five minutes
to understand why.

691
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,830
A lot of lonely young men
down here.

692
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,070
Supposed to keep their hands
off the merchandise.

693
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,670
<i> Creates something</i>
<i> of an opening</i>

694
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,470
that I'm sure
you were eager to fill.

695
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,430
<i> It's all right, darling.</i>

696
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,230
I'm an entrepreneur myself.

697
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,750
I'll forego my cut

698
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,510
in exchange
for some alterations.

699
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,230
<i> Hmm?</i>

700
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,710
- ( phone chirping )
-<i> ( line ringing )</i>

701
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,830
- Elsie:<i> Hey.</i>
- What did you find?

702
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,910
Okay, so,
Theresa was using

703
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,790
the old bicameral
control system

704
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,710
to reprogram
the woodcutter,

705
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,550
but she's not
the only one.

706
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,910
<i> Someone else has been</i>
<i> using the system</i>

707
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,710
<i> for weeks</i>
<i> to retask hosts.</i>

708
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,550
- Which hosts?
-<i> I don't know,</i>
several of them.

709
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,750
It had to have been
the older models.

710
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,070
The newer ones
don't have receivers,

711
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,390
but these modifications,
they are serious.

712
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,390
Changing loops,
breaking loops.

713
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,710
<i> Some of these changes are</i>
<i> to their prime directives,</i>
<i> Bernard.</i>

714
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,390
They could lie to us.

715
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,270
Maybe even hurt us
or the guests.

716
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,350
- Who issued
the modifications?
-<i> I don't know.</i>

717
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,110
<i> The best I could tell--</i>

718
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,190
- Arnold.
- He's dead.

719
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,510
<i> Yeah, well, he's a pretty</i>
<i> fucking prolific coder</i>

720
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:26,750
for a dead guy.

721
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,430
Whatever argument
he was having with Ford,

722
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,270
it doesn't seem like
he was done making his point.

723
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,670
<i> I'm gonna transfer</i>
<i> all the data and</i>
<i> bring it to you.</i>

724
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,630
- You need to see this.
-<i> I'll be in my office.</i>

725
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,070
Okay.

726
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,190
Dr. Ford:
I don't want you
to worry about Jock.

727
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,830
I'll fix him.

728
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,070
But I need you to tell me
what happened to it.

729
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,590
It saw a rabbit
and it ran.

730
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,230
I found it like that.

731
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,430
Analysis.

732
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,390
Are you lying to me, boy?

733
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:04,110
Yes.

734
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:09,190
Tell me what
really happened to it.

735
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,910
I killed it.

736
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,990
Why?

737
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,150
- I don't know.
-<i> That's not good enough,</i>
Robert.

738
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,550
Tell me what happened.

739
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:22,430
<i> It caught the rabbit</i>
<i> and it killed it.</i>

740
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,150
<i> And then...</i>

741
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,230
<i> someone told me</i>
<i> to put it out of its misery.</i>

742
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,030
Who told you?

743
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,590
A voice.

744
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,070
Whose voice?

745
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,270
Arnold.

746
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,590
He told me
it was a killer,

747
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,070
but it wasn't its fault.

748
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,950
It was made that way,

749
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,990
and I could help it.

750
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,430
Help it?

751
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,470
If it was dead,

752
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,070
it couldn't hurt
anything anymore.

753
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,470
( screeching )

754
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,190
What the fuck?

755
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,430
Oh, shit.

756
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,990
<i> ( floorboard creaks )</i>

757
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,430
Hello?

758
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,310
Bernard?

759
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,950
Hello?

760
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,430
Arnold?

761
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,350
( gasps )

762
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,670
I'm in.

00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,870
<i> ( tablet clatters )</i>

764
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,070
You're up.

765
00:51:58,510 --> 00:51:59,950
Loyalty.

766
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,950
Mine's been taken
advantage of,

767
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,150
wouldn't you say?

768
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,790
<i> Let's lower that a tad.</i>

769
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,150
And pain, I'd prefer
it sting less

770
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,750
next time I want
one of these chats.

771
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,870
Wait.
What does this mean?

772
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,870
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

773
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,710
- Paranoia,
self-preservation.
- Fuck!

774
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,910
Someone's already
been altering her

775
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,430
in an unlogged session,

776
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,230
someone with a fuck ton
more privileges than us.

777
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,790
- What does that mean?
- Don't know what it means
for you, sweetheart,

778
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,150
but I know
what it means for me.

779
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,510
I am done with this.

780
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,550
So, you're done with
your little side income?

781
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,110
<i> Probably your job, too.</i>

782
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,030
Seeing as you have ambitions
in my line of work,

783
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,790
<i> let me tell you</i>
<i> what I tell my new girls--</i>

784
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,910
never start something
you're not willing to finish.

785
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,390
And if you're getting fucked
either way,

786
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,150
go with
the lucrative version...

787
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:50,350
sweetheart.

788
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,830
Now...

789
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,390
last but not least--

790
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,150
what was it?

791
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,830
Bulk apperception.

792
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,350
Let's take that
all the way to the top.

793
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,110
<i> Please.</i>

Dear boys,

00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,390

some fun, aren't we?
