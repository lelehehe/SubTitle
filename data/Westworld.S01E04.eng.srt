     telling them something.
     - And we're not!

145
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,998
There is
clearly a pattern
of behavior here.

146
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,278
First there was Abernathy,
and now there's this.

147
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,678
    I mean, I've got
    hosts imagining voices
    and climbing mountaintops

148
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,118
    to consult
    their astrological chart.

149
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,438
<i>This is not</i>
<i>a fucking glitch.</i>

150
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,838
     And for some reason,
     you don't want me
     to tell anyone.

151
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,518
<i>It is like</i>
<i>everybody around here</i>

152
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,518
    has got some kind of
    fucking agenda
    except for me.

153
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,478
  And-- what?

154
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,078
      I remember when
      I first started here.

155
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,078
        The hosts seemed
        very lifelike.

156
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,998
       You begin to read things
       into their behaviors.

157
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,678
     - Don't be patronizing.
     - Fine.

158
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,798
     The hosts don't
     imagine things, you do.

159
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:02,877
               That's not Orion.

160
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,438
          There are three stars
          in Orion's Belt,
          not four.

161
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,318
       <i> ( birds chirping )</i>

162
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,918
                      William:
                      <i> Hey.</i>

163
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,798
     You must be cold.

164
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,158
        Take that.

165
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,278
   Thank you.

166
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:28,598
                      Sure.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,518
                     ( sighs )

168
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,278
We gotta take her back
to Sweetwater.

169
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,038
       Are you fucking kidding?

170
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,878
   Come on, Logan,
you know she doesn't
  belong out here.

171
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,237
            You leave now,
            that no-good outlaw
            Slim Miller

172
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,478
               is sure to evade
               our grasp.

173
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,878
              No fucking way.

174
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,478
       You were the one
       who dragged me on
       this stupid bounty hunt.

175
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,718
     The least we're going to do
     is see it through, okay?

176
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,837
  We can't take her
  on a bounty hunt.

177
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,718
    If you're so concerned
     about her well-being,

178
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,557
            I'll just blow
            her brains out,

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,718
             and then the park
            will come get her.

180
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,078
      Hey, hey.

181
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,598
      Can you please
      stop trying

182
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,558
    to just kill
    or fuck everything?

183
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:11,238
                   Oh. Oh.

184
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,238
                Now I get it.

185
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,797
          What?

186
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,558
        The park sent her
        so that you will finally

187
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,078
         have something
         to give a shit about.

188
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,718
 Oh, yeah, I'm sure
 the people at the controls

189
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,998
     are monitoring
     my every mood.

190
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,918
            That's exactly
            what they're doing.

191
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,078
      Come on, you really think
      it's a coincidence

192
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,078
           that the only thing
         that you even smiled at
           back in Sweetwater

193
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,198
         just happened to drop
         into your lap?

194
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,638
        This is why the company

195
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,198
        needs to bump our stake
        in this place.

196
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,877
        They can even give you
        a sense of purpose.

197
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,198
    You said the trip
    was about welcoming me
    to the family.

198
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,157
    This is business?

199
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,397
      With our family, William,
      everything is business.

200
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,717
Holden:
<i>We better get</i>
<i>a move on, gentlemen.</i>

201
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,638
            ( sighs )

202
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,518
             ( rattling )

203
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,277
         This should be
         the place, Lawrence.

204
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,998
               The Blood Arroyo.

205
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,118
  Plenty of snakes, but none
  of the egg-laying variety.

206
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,678
Lawrence:
<i>You killed my wife,</i>

207
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,598
  severely pruned
  my family tree

208
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,957
all in pursuit
of some goddamn maze.

209
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,038
The hell you hope
to find, anyway?

210
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,797
              This whole world
              is a story.

211
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,798
           I've read every page
           except the last one.

212
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,038
            I need to find out
            how it ends.

213
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,918
          I want to know
          what this all means.

214
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,918
See, now that's why
I never learned to read.

215
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,718
Why don't we forget
about this damn snake,

216
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,997
    head to Pariah?

217
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,118
        My friends there
          can help us.

218
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,478
        Well, your friends have
       nothing I'm looking for,

219
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,038
         not this trip.

220
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,757
           Besides...

221
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,998
 I think we found
 our snake after all.

222
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,518
      Shame on you.

223
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,838
You were a married man
up until yesterday.

224
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,877
                  Her? Hell, no.

225
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,037
           I like a little fire
           in my women.

226
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,557
              The only thing
              she's ever mounted

227
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,037
are dead heads
on sticks.

228
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,718
     -<i> We should get</i>
     <i> the fuck out of--</i>
     -<i> ( gun hammer clicks )</i>

229
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,198
               ( guns clicking )

230
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,717
   We found
   some more food
   for the horses.

231
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,997
                      Good.

232
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,198
             They were starting
             to get ornery.

233
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,198
   My friend and I were
   just admiring your tattoo.

234
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,798
We'd love to know
the story behind it.

235
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,517
        I like your hat.

236
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,358
       Maybe I'll keep it.

237
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,917
      - The horses can have
      the rest of you.
      - ( laughs )

238
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,557
How in hell
have we never met?

239
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,478
    Clearly
    a terrible oversight
    on my part.

240
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,557
        Where, may I ask,
        are you headed?

241
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,917
          To retrieve something
          of great value.

242
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,638
    You look
    a little shorthanded.

243
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,117
We got enough men.

244
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,517
  Seems like you got
  a couple positions open.

245
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:52,117
     We've got a host making
     a pretty big deviation
     from her loop.

246
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,118
    - Which one?
    - The rancher's daughter
    from Sweetwater.

247
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,157
                      Dolores.

248
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,878
      - Is she accompanying
      a guest?
      - Unclear.

249
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,117
        The boss is disrupting
        so many storylines

250
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,398
        with his new narrative,
        it's hard to tell.

251
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,037
     Flag her with behavior.
    They can pull her today.

252
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,557
        Make sure everything's
        checking out.

253
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,437

       <i> ( rooster crows )</i>

255
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,918
          Good morning.

256
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,437
    It's a lovely town.
    Is this your home?

257
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,598
    Well, where are you from?

258
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,558
             Same as you.

259
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,237
          Don't you remember?

260
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,798

                        <i> Ma'am?</i>

263
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,717
              Got word a girl
             went missing from
             Abernathy Ranch.

264
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,957
    Is that where
    you belong?

265
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,157
I'm sure your daddy's
worried about you.

266
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,077

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,958
            My father's dead.

269
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,798
           I'm not going back.

270
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,357
What's going on here?

271
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,997
Oh, just helping
a lost traveler.

272
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,837
      She's not lost,
      she's with me.

273
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,237
                 My mistake.

274
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,198
         - Y'all have
         a nice morning.
         - Yeah.

275
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,758
So, we got a lead
on Slim.

276
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,037
    You can stay here
    if you want,

277
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,597
    and I'll
    just circle back
    and get you.

278
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,157
            No, I think I need
            to keep going.

279
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,358
                Okay.

280
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,077
          Apparently, she needs
          to make certain

281
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,198
      this thing
      they're looking for
      is where they think it is.

282
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,677
    She said she'd signal
    if the information was good.

00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,478
          - ( grunts )
          - ( groans )

286
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,077
        ( gunshot )

287
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,117
       Guess
       that's the signal.

288
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,997
              ( horse whinnies )

289
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,878
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
with you and your friend.

290
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,157
                  Oh, no, no.
                  No, it's fine.

291
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,837
          I'm glad you found us.

292
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,638
     I didn't get a chance
     to ask where you're headed.

293
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,677
    I don't really know yet.

294
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,878
        I guess I figured
        they kept you in zones

295
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,717
           or on paths or...

296
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,438
      I used to believe
      there was a path
      for everyone.

297
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,878
Now I think
I never asked

298
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,597
where that path
was taking me.

299
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,277
  We would bring the herd
  down off the mountain

300
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,678
      in the fall.

301
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,637
     Sometimes
     we would lose one
     along the way,

302
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,477
  and I'd worry over it.

303
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,997
        My father...

304
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,637
      My father
      would tell me...

305
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,917
that the steer would find
its own way home.

306
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,717
And, often as not,
they did.

307
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:26,638
  Never occurred to me
  that we were bring them back
  for the slaughter.

308
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,277
           How are you going
           to find your way now?

309
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,438
           ( exhales )

310
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,157
       I'm not sure
       you'll understand.

311
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,797
       Sometimes I feel...

312
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,517
        like something's
        calling me.

313
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,117
     Telling me
     there's a place for me

314
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:05,077
   somewhere beyond all this.

315
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,677
Oh, I know
that feeling, Dolores.

316
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,477
I know that feeling.

317
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,438
But you really
don't want to go back
to your old life?

318
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:21,277
     <i> ( voices whispering )</i>

319
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,557
      <i> ( distant clinking )</i>

320
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,917
       ( muffled chatter )

321
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,958
          ( wheezing )

322
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,557
       Are you all right?

323
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,838
           - ( gasps )
           - Hey, hey.

324
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:56,317
You all right?

325
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,878
             I just got a chill.

326
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,397
                  That's all.

327
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,197
Let's-- let's go back
to the fire.

328
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,557
You're probably
exhausted.

329
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,717
       <i> ( coyote howling )</i>

330
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,677
       - Just talk to him.
       - All right.

331
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,157
            Uh, excuse me, sir?

332
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,677
       I didn't want to intrude,
       but I just had to say

333
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,597
            that I'm such
            an admirer of yours.

334
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:32,197
               <i> Your foundation</i>
               <i> literally saved</i>
               <i> my sister's--</i>

335
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:34,277
            One more word
            and I'll cut
            your throat.

336
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,078
    Understand?

337
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,437
      This is
      my fucking vacation.

338
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,277
          Apparently, whatever
           they're looking for

339
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,237
         is in the Ojal prison.

340
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,277
        These lunatics
        plan to steal a cannon

341
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,438
         from the Union
          cavalry unit.

342
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,757
       Blast their way in.

343
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,357
I don't have time
for color-by-numbers
bullshit.

344
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,917
           I'll ride at dawn.

345
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,117
           I'll go get
           whatever you want
           out of that prison

346
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,717
             and bring it
             back myself.

347
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,077
     Suppose you make it
     out alive.

348
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,077
     What's your price?

349
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,197
        Nothing but a few words.

350
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:26,357
            I want the story
            behind your tattoo.

351
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,237
     What's your interest
     in it?

352
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,917
        You ever heard
        of a man named Arnold?

353
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:37,397
           You could say he was
           the original settler
           of these parts.

354
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:41,237
       He created a world
       where you could do
       anything you want,

355
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,477
       except one thing--

356
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,677
         you can't die.

357
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,717
            Which means
            no matter how real
            this world seems,

358
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,237
         it's still just a game.

359
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,077
        But then Arnold went
        and broke his own rule.

360
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,797
       He died right here
       in the park.

361
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,837
        Except I believe
        he had one story
        left to tell.

362
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,877
A story
with real stakes,

363
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,597
real violence.

364
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:15,237
    You could say
    I'm here to honor
    his legacy.

365
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,637
And I think your tattoo
is the next piece
of the puzzle.

366
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,997
        So, do we have
        a wager?

367
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,557
        You aim to break
        into a prison

368
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,717
          and take out
          20 men alone?

369
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,637
         Not alone.

370
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,237
       I'll take
       Lawrence here.

371
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,317
          And I'll need
          one match.

372
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,477
           One match,

373
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,757
         one pistol,
         and one idiot.

374
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,277
        ( chuckles )

375
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,557
        I'll take those odds.

376
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,157
                Hyah!

377
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,397
You gonna give me
the silent treatment
the whole way there?

378
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:11,237
Lawrence:
<i>You should've left me</i>
<i>hanging from those gallows.</i>

379
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,797
            At least I could've
            died in peace

380
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,557
            without having
            to hear you yammer.

381
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,717
( chuckles )

382
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,277
        Aah.

383
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,357
               Don't suppose
               you have a light?

384
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,757
    No smoking in here.

385
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,477
            <i> Normally, I'm sure,</i>

386
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,157
            but this
      is the finest tobacco

387
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,077
        a man can enjoy.

388
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,197
           Hand-rolled
       on the ample thighs
        of exotic women.

389
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,957
           <i> Perhaps you'd like</i>
           <i> to try one yourself.</i>

390
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,277
                      <i> ( sighs )</i>

391
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,117
 Choices, Lawrence.

392
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,397
You know, you tell
yourself you've been
at the mercy of mine

393
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:00,357
because it spares you
consideration
of your own.

394
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:02,837
Because if you did
consider your choices,

395
00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:04,277
you'd be confronted
with a truth

396
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:06,397
you could not
comprehend--

397
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:10,397
    that no choice
     you ever made
     was your own.

398
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:13,077
You have always been
a prisoner.

399
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,916
  What if I told you
  I'm here to set you free?

400
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,596
  Hyah!

401
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,077
          Whoa.

402
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,277
            Let's go!

403
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,037
                  Horse thieves.

404
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,317
              Damn fools shot up

405
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:53,437
            a couple of pokes
            practically in front
            of us.

406
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:56,797
    Well, the only fool
    I see is the one standing
    right in front of me.

407
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,317
     <i> Deputy, you have there</i>
     <i> in your custody</i>

408
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:00,917
     the most wanted man
     in three territories--

409
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,276
             <i> Lawrence Pedro</i>
            <i> Maria Gonzalez.</i>

410
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,197
         Yeah.

411
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,077
  Heard you slipped
  the rope.

412
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,637
                 <i> Dropped some</i>
                <i> damn good men</i>
                 <i> in exchange.</i>

413
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:15,997
           Man in Black:
           The way he tells it,

414
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,917
       he's more partial
      to a firing squad.

415
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,197
       <i> I reckon we'll be happy</i>
       <i> to oblige.</i>

416
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,277
        I'm gonna fucking
        kill you.

417
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:35,477
              Maybe someday.

418
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,956
       Lock him up
       with the other man.

419
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,757
      Enjoy the cigars.

420
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,517
       - Go fuck yourself.
       - ( laughs )

421
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,956
              Man:
      <i> And just who are you</i>
        <i> supposed to be?</i>

422
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,876
         Your salvation.

423
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,556
      - Man: Hyah, hyah!
      - ( horse whinnies )

424
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,196
          ( man yells )

425
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,956
Hector:
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>we've ever met.</i>

426
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,397
           No, we haven't.

427
00:29:30,678 --> 00:29:33,597
    You know, you always
    seemed like a--

428
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,116
         a market-tested
         kind of thing.

429
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,117
         Big gun, tasteful scar.

430
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,437
           Locked
           in your little cycle

431
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:45,476
           like a prized poodle
            after its own tail.

432
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,796
         You sound like a man
         who's grown tired

433
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,637
         of wearing his guts
         on the inside.

434
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,236
                <i> There's no need</i>
                <i> to get testy.</i>

435
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,077
           I'm just curious
           about your worldview.

436
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,277
       Some kind of half-native
       mumbo jumbo?

437
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,717
<i>It's simple.</i>

438
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,237
    I believe that
    only the truly brave

439
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,797
    can look at the world
    and understand

440
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:06,316
    that all of it--

441
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,717
    gods, men,

442
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,877
<i>everything else--</i>
<i>will end badly.</i>

443
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,077
      No one will be saved.

444
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,277
            Maybe we've got
            more in common
            than I thought.

445
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,717
<i>What about you?</i>

446
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:22,317
        What turns of fate
        have brought you here?

447
00:30:22,358 --> 00:30:25,277
It's a long story.

448
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,717
And we don't have
the time.

449
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,477
            Got more time
            than your friend,
            sadly.

450
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:31,917
<i>It will be a few more days</i>
<i>before my friends show up.</i>

451
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:32,837
       Three days.

452
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:34,277
                      <i> Normally.</i>

453
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:36,877
         I'm afraid I don't
         have time for that,

454
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,517
        so we're leaving now.

455
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,676
    I've got a request
    for a pyrotechnic effect.

456
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,917
       <i> Los Diablos,</i>
       <i> low-yield, two charges.</i>

457
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,757
            Approved.

458
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:54,476
                  Authorizing.

459
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,397
                    ( grunting )

460
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:18,036
    Step lively, Hector.

461
00:31:32,318 --> 00:31:33,917
              Any last words?

462
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,637
 Get it over with.

463
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,797
          <i> ( gunshots )</i>

464
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:59,717
     - ( yells out ) Yah!
     - ( gunshots continue )

465
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:01,197
( groans )

466
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:07,517
      -<i> ( gunshot echoes )</i>
      - ( groans )

467
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:14,077
          Motherfucker.

468
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,917
         One match.

469
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,196
      You're a capable man.

470
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,516
      We could do with your help
      where we're going.

471
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,756
               Afraid not.

472
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,996
       We owe you a debt.

473
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,756
            No, your friend here

474
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:35,757
               simply owes me
               a word or two.

475
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:36,796
                <i> That'll do.</i>

476
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,917
         <i> And a word of advice--</i>

477
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,797
          that thing
          you're looking for?

478
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:44,277
            You're never
            gonna find it
            in that safe.

479
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:03,197
             I was seven
             when they rode
             into my town.

480
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:05,556
             Masked men
             in devils' horns.

481
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:06,917
          They killed everyone--

482
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,716
             women, children,
             even the animals.

483
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,517
        They gutted my mother
        from her jaw to her sex.

484
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:18,596
               <i> I had to paint</i>
               <i> her warm blood</i>

485
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:20,197
                  <i> over my skin</i>
                  <i> to make sure</i>

486
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:22,277
             <i> that they would</i>
             <i> think I was dead.</i>

487
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:23,757
             Every one of them
             I tracked down,

488
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:26,676
         I used their blood
         to paint my skin again.

489
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,997
       Only one man left.

490
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:33,716
     The head of the snake.

491
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,356
       What's his name?

492
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:43,397
            He has many names.

493
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,316
             Most know him
             as Wyatt.

494
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,677
    -<i> ( chatter )</i>
    -<i> ( distant dog barking )</i>

495
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:58,997
      -<i> ( horse whinnies )</i>
      -<i> ( bell ringing )</i>

496
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:08,317
        <i> ( baby crying )</i>

497
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:46,076
    Hey, little girl,
    what-- what is this?

498
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,316
What does it mean?

499
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:49,357
       Don't waste
       your breath, lady.

500
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:52,436
    That thing's part
    of their so-called religion.

501
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,677
          Ain't none of them's
          gonna tell you nothing
          about that.

502
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:01,117
     -<i> ( chatter, laughter )</i>
     -<i> ( piano playing )</i>

503
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,596
Clementine:
<i>It's $5 for an hour,</i>

504
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:07,516
    4 if you bathe first.

505
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:09,836
   Well, if we just
   get the one,

506
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:13,317
do I get a discount
for being second and all?

507
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,436
      I'm sure we can work
      something out.

508
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,997
                 Come on.

509
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:32,237
           The tall one,
           I've seen him before,

510
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:33,836
      hanging in the window
      of the post office.

511
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:35,117
Bandits?

512
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,756
    Do you think
    they're here
    for something?

513
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,476
       I think
       they're interested
       in more than a turn

514
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:40,116
        at Franny's backside.

515
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:43,316
           I think he rides
           with Hector.

516
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,316
    Is that the one
    they say lives out
    with the savages?

517
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:52,437
            That's the one.

518
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,237
            Bernard:
          <i> Taking off?</i>
        <i> I just got here.</i>

519
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:04,836
   You gave me what I needed.

520
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:09,037
       So, is that all
       I'm good for?

521
00:36:09,078 --> 00:36:11,996
    -<i> Letting off</i>
    <i> a little stress?</i>
    - Who says I'm stressed?

522
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,036
     You have your tells.

523
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:18,877
               Oh, yes, Bernard,

524
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,276
         master
         of observation.

525
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,556
              Tomorrow I have
             to talk to Ford.

526
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:35,276
      - Why?
      - He's creating chaos
      in the park.

527
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,396
                 And the board
              will be descending
                at any moment.

528
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:40,236
                I need to buy
                some time.

529
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:42,637
    Some advice?

530
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:45,836
            Best to not show him
            you're nervous
            or defensive.

531
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:48,196
        I have nothing
        to be defensive about.

532
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,997
Then don't cross
your arms.

533
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:52,917
It's an ancient instinct.

534
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,476
The belly is the most
vulnerable part
of every animal.

535
00:36:57,078 --> 00:36:59,556
    It's so sexy
    being compared
    to a frightened beast.

536
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,596
                    Ah.

537
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,556
                     There.

538
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,836
             That's the posture
             you're looking for.

539
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,116
               Sometimes,

540
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:17,276
       despite
       your best efforts,

541
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,956
         you can actually be
         quite charming.

542
00:37:24,798 --> 00:37:26,797
     ( explosion )

543
00:37:33,278 --> 00:37:35,396
     Have the neighbors
     complained?

544
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:38,317
       Safe to say,
       they're asking questions.

545
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:41,197
   The rocks
   would prefer
   not to move,

546
00:37:41,238 --> 00:37:42,996
but we shall
move them yet.

547
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:48,516
           Perhaps I can
           help you with that.

548
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,756
            The narrative
            you're creating

549
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:51,757
            is clearly
            a massive endeavor.

550
00:37:51,798 --> 00:37:53,756
         <i> If you need more time,</i>
         <i> I'm sure the board</i>

551
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:55,196
                <i> would be happy</i>
                <i> to oblige.</i>

552
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:56,436
  I'm sure
  they'd be happier

553
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:58,516
  for me to delay it
  indefinitely.

554
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:03,036
    Come with me.

555
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:05,236
       ( hosts grunting )

556
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:15,757
              You imagine
              I have gone mad...

557
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:16,837
                do you?

558
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,876
          Lost my way?

559
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:19,276
  We're simply concerned

560
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:22,276
    about the extent
    of the changes
    you're making.

561
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:24,797
    We want to protect
    your legacy.

562
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,156
               My legacy?

563
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:29,877
                ( chuckles )

564
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:35,156
            You don't
            like this place
            very much, do you?

565
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:37,476
         I've seen
         many of you come and go
         over the years,

566
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:40,437
              and I can tell
            the ones who enjoy
              their time here

567
00:38:40,478 --> 00:38:42,516
         and the ones who don't.

568
00:38:42,558 --> 00:38:44,557
     I admire it,

569
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:46,276
  the audacity of it.

570
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:49,556
      - Oh.
      - I've forgotten
      how beautiful it is.

571
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:52,396
I came here once
as a child with
my parents.

572
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:54,596
  I think we even sat
  at this table.

573
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:57,356
   Or maybe--
   maybe that one.

574
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,756
     When I started
      working here,

575
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:07,997
I realized this place
wasn't something
I would enjoy.

576
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,596
                   Ah.

577
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:16,076
      In the beginning,
      I imagined things would be

578
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:18,516
         perfectly balanced.

579
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:22,036
            Even had a bet
       with my partner, Arnold,
            to that effect.

580
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:23,956
            We made a hundred
            hopeful storylines.

581
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:26,836
       Of course, almost no one
       took us up on them.

582
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,956
            I lost the bet.

583
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:33,276
         Arnold always held
         a somewhat dim view
         of people.

584
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,157
         He preferred the hosts.

585
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:37,316
       He begged me
       to not let you people in,

586
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,597
            the moneymen.

587
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:39,876
                        <i> Delos.</i>

588
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:41,556
                <i> But I told him</i>
                <i> we'd be fine,</i>

589
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:44,036
   that you didn't understand
    what you were paying for.

590
00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:47,556
    It's not a business venture,
    not a theme park,

591
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:50,956
      but an entire world.

592
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:52,196
            <i> We designed</i>
            <i> every inch of it.</i>

593
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:57,076
           Every blade of grass.

594
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:07,117
     In here, we were gods.

595
00:40:07,158 --> 00:40:10,836
       And you were
       merely our guests.

596
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:31,236
    And how did that
    work out for Arnold?

597
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:35,596
       Sadly, he lost
       his perspective.

598
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:38,236
         He went mad.

599
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:40,516
        I haven't,
        as you well know.

600
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:44,196
          I have always
          seen things

601
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,156
          very clearly.

602
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:54,476
   This is the table I sat at
        with my parents.

603
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:58,676
        This is the chair
            I sat in.

604
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,636
       We know everything
   about our guests, don't we?

605
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:05,516
      As we know everything
      about our employees.

606
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:11,196
       I do hope you will
       be careful with Bernard.

607
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:17,236
           He has a sensitive
           disposition.

608
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:21,996
     I beg your pardon,
     <i> señorita.</i>

609
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:32,996
         <i> There have been many</i>
         <i> of you over the years,</i>

610
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:35,396
         and we have always--
         almost always

611
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:37,756
        found a way
        to make it work.

612
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:42,596
   So, I will ask you nicely,

613
00:41:42,638 --> 00:41:44,556
               please...

614
00:41:44,598 --> 00:41:46,516
          don't get in my way.

615
00:42:01,038 --> 00:42:03,556
   The board
   will agree with me.

616
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:05,396
   They'll be sending
    a representative.

617
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:07,076
        But they already have.

618
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:08,756
       I thought
       they would've told you.

619
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:13,356
              That won't be
              necessary, Manu.

620
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,116
                  Not anymore.

621
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,316
        You can join the others.

622
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:23,356
          <i> ( rumbling )</i>

623
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,596
        <i> You can tell the board</i>
        <i> that my narrative</i>

624
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,396
      will be completed
      on time,

625
00:42:36,438 --> 00:42:39,396
       and it won't be
      a retrospective,

626
00:42:39,438 --> 00:42:41,916
      <i> as I'm sure</i>
      <i> you have all feared.</i>

627
00:42:49,638 --> 00:42:51,956
             I'm not
      the sentimental type.

628
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:55,436
          ( booming, squeaking )

629
00:43:01,758 --> 00:43:05,436
      Holden says this Slim's
      got a whole gang with him,

630
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,596
               so I need you
               to stay here.

631
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:09,076
     If you're outnumbered,
     the last thing you need

632
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:10,396
          is somebody
         standing by.

633
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:12,236
          - I can help.
          - No, no, no.

634
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:15,556
        Um, I know
        it doesn't make
        any sense to you,

635
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:17,636
         but I can't get hurt
         in there, but you can.

636
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,556
             I would hate
             to see that happen.

637
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,316
                 Just stay here.

638
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:23,636
                 <i> Okay? Be safe.</i>

639
00:43:27,798 --> 00:43:30,076
    <i> ( distant man shouting )</i>

640
00:43:33,198 --> 00:43:36,116
        - Aw. Did you get
        a good-bye kiss?
        - Shut up.

641
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,196
    Seriously, if you
    don't bang her
    by tomorrow,

642
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:39,356
    I'm calling dibs.

643
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:40,556
Holden:
Okay, listen up.

644
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:42,076
It's gonna be
a bag of nails in there.

645
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:44,556
Slim and his boys
got us outnumbered.

646
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:47,076
 On top of that,
there's a family
runs this place.

647
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:48,596
 Good people.

648
00:43:48,638 --> 00:43:50,756
We need to make sure
that snake-hearted
son of a bitch

649
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:52,116
       - doesn't try to--
       - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

650
00:43:52,158 --> 00:43:53,916
              Risk, reward.
              We got it.

651
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:56,396
            Come on.
            Let's go fuck
            these fuckers up.

652
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:00,916
The fuck is that?

653
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:03,076
          - ( laughs )
          - Huh?

654
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:04,676
        - I look like
        a dog to you?
        - No, sir.

655
00:44:04,718 --> 00:44:06,995
       - Huh? Huh?
       - ( men laughing )

656
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:09,396
Feed that to them.

657
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,996
        ( barks )

658
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:13,636
   Slap leather, cocksuckers.

668
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:16,795
       Upgrade.

669
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:17,916
        Nice.

670
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,596
      Lawrence:
      Ain't normally
      the type to complain,

671
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,436
     but this
     is just foolhardy.

672
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:26,556
Two men taking on Wyatt.

673
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,356
       Man in Black:
       Keep talking,
       and I'm gonna take

674
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:30,196
         the horse back,
         Lawrence.

675
00:45:30,237 --> 00:45:32,116
            Wyatt's freaks
            just wiped out
            the last group

676
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:34,996
              that went
              seeking him out.

677
00:45:35,037 --> 00:45:38,195
         And here we are
         riding right after him.

678
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:43,275
            I'm just trying
            to convince you

679
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,996
not to get yourself
and me as a bystander
killed.

680
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:49,196
              I'm not gonna get
              myself killed.

                  ( chuckles )

682
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:53,076
Don't think
I didn't notice
that distinction.

00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:16,076
     Looks like Wyatt's men
     left somebody behind

688
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,995
         I should've guessed.

689
00:46:24,037 --> 00:46:26,836
    Please, put me
    out of my misery.

690
00:46:27,837 --> 00:46:29,716
          I'm sorry, Teddy.

691
00:46:31,398 --> 00:46:33,396
         It looks like
         misery's all you got.

           <i> God damn it!</i>

693
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,916

        That reward

694
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,836
     Holden:
     Always best
     to bring them in alive.

695
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:44,435
        Can we at least gag him?

696
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:46,635
     That's a fine idea.

697
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,116
        Whoa.

<i>Aw, come on.</i>

          he'll pay you twice
          what the marshals will

704
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:03,076
           if you cut me loose
           and get me to Pariah.

705
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:05,035
   - Listen to me,
   you lowdown piece of dirt.
   - Hey.

706
00:47:05,078 --> 00:47:06,276
       - ( mutters )
       - These men won't--

707
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:08,435
      - ( gunshot )
      - ( horse whinnies )

708
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,116
         What the fuck?!

709
00:47:11,158 --> 00:47:12,835
Logan:
<i>Relax, man.</i>

710
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:15,276
You have no idea
how lucky we just got.

711
00:47:15,317 --> 00:47:17,036
              Lucky?
              You just shot
              an innocent man.

712
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:20,036
No, he's a robot,
just like her and
just like Slim here,

713
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:22,636
  except that Slim
  works for El Lazo,

714
00:47:22,678 --> 00:47:24,676
    and El Lazo
    is our ticket

715
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:26,596
    to the best ride
    in the park.

716
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:30,235
Your bullshit mission
led us right to
an Easter egg.

717
00:47:30,277 --> 00:47:32,476
          - ( grunts )
          - ( groans )

718
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:34,156
        You're not going
        to let him go.

719
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:36,955
    Well, well.
   Look at you.

720
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:38,556
You're starting
to grow on me, farm girl.

721
00:47:38,598 --> 00:47:39,916
Now, out of the way.

722
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:42,875
        - Oh.
        - Don't you dare.

723
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:44,596
   ( laughing )
   See?

724
00:47:44,637 --> 00:47:45,755
This is gonna be fun!

725
00:47:45,798 --> 00:47:47,196
Now we're each
gonna have one.

726
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:49,116
I won't fuck mine
either.

727
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,356
              You're disgusting.

728
00:47:50,397 --> 00:47:51,836
Just an acquired taste.

729
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:53,516
    You're gonna grow
    to love me,
    I promise.

730
00:47:56,238 --> 00:47:57,916
    Come on. Hmm?

731
00:47:59,637 --> 00:48:01,395
         Come on.

732
00:48:01,438 --> 00:48:04,076
      Go black hat with me.

733
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:06,636
    Come on, you got to,
    you know, save the girl.

734
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:07,835
  Now give me
  a little something.

735
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:09,156
           What is your problem?

736
00:48:09,197 --> 00:48:11,076
    The second we get away
    from the real world,

737
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:12,156
     you turn
     into an evil prick.

738
00:48:12,198 --> 00:48:14,036
          Evil?
          ( chuckles )

739
00:48:14,078 --> 00:48:16,156
      It's a fucking game,
      Billy!

740
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:19,116
     -<i> Don't call me Billy!</i>
     -<i> Are you still trying</i>
     to impress her?

741
00:48:19,158 --> 00:48:20,796
    Because I guarantee
    she does not give a shit

742
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:21,996
  about how you play
  this game.

743
00:48:22,038 --> 00:48:23,195
               <i> Do you, Dolores?</i>

744
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:24,435
What's he talking about,
William?

745
00:48:24,478 --> 00:48:26,635
  She will be just fine

746
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:28,555
  with a trip
  down the dark side.

747
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:30,315
  And so will you.

748
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,036
  Trust me.

749
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:45,435
So, which way to Pariah?

750
00:48:45,478 --> 00:48:48,116
       Oh, you just let me
       take it from here.

751
00:48:53,357 --> 00:48:55,435
            All right, time for
            the floor show.

752
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:57,676
         Got some guests riding
         with Hector this time.

753
00:49:17,198 --> 00:49:19,876
Stubbs:
Let's give them
something to shoot at.

754
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:23,316
      Retask a few
      of those soldiers.

755
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:24,795
               Deputy:
               If you're riding
               into our town

756
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:26,675
               under the company
               of armed men,

757
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:28,836
           <i> you'll need to state</i>
           <i> your business.</i>

758
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:30,955
         Mayhem.

759
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:33,835
      <i> ( people screaming )</i>

760
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:56,755
          <i> ( gunshots )</i>

761
00:50:11,117 --> 00:50:13,396
              Well, hello there.

762
00:50:13,437 --> 00:50:14,955
                I want to talk.

763
00:50:14,997 --> 00:50:17,595
Interesting way
of starting a conversation.

764
00:50:17,638 --> 00:50:20,916
        Oh, it's an interesting
        kind of day.

765
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:29,716
                      ( sighs )

766
00:50:29,757 --> 00:50:32,275
          Now, my lovely friend,

767
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:34,995
              what deal is it
              you want to make?

768
00:50:35,037 --> 00:50:37,595
You're here
for what's in the safe.

769
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:38,876
                 Now, how would
                 you know that?

770
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:41,116
I can always tell
when a man wants something

771
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:42,835
that's not on the menu.

772
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:46,316
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>the combination</i>

773
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:48,356
   in exchange
   for some answers.

774
00:50:48,398 --> 00:50:49,996
            <i> You assume</i>
            <i> I have any answers.</i>

775
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:53,955
     This world is madness.

776
00:50:53,998 --> 00:50:56,196
             ( chuckling )

777
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:58,396
I want to know about this.

778
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:02,116
      I've got a couple families
      in the homestead

779
00:51:02,157 --> 00:51:03,235
              who changed
              their itinerary.

780
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,996
       They're headed into town.

781
00:51:05,037 --> 00:51:06,835
           <i> Should be there</i>
           <i> in 20 minutes or so.</i>

782
00:51:06,878 --> 00:51:08,516
                <i> The place</i>
                <i> is a bloodbath.</i>

783
00:51:08,558 --> 00:51:09,876
              Fine.

784
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:11,235
       Cut these guys off.

785
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:13,275
    Jam their weapons
    and send in the cavalry.

786
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:23,115
      - ( rifle clicking )
      - Oh, shit.

787
00:51:25,997 --> 00:51:27,436
              We'll give them
              a night in lockup,

788
00:51:27,478 --> 00:51:28,956
                then have
                one of the girls
                at the Mariposa

789
00:51:28,998 --> 00:51:30,835
      bring them a key
      hidden in their breakfast.

790
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:33,835
           If the guests
           are squared away,
           let's wrap it up.

791
00:51:33,877 --> 00:51:35,436
    This is a shade.

792
00:51:35,477 --> 00:51:37,196
             <i> ( match strikes )</i>

793
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:39,516
<i>Sacred native lore.</i>

794
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:41,716
   They make
   figures of them.

795
00:51:43,717 --> 00:51:45,075
                  60.

796
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:54,675
          And what does
          the shade do?

797
00:51:55,757 --> 00:51:56,995
     You've seen this?

798
00:51:57,037 --> 00:51:58,915
           What is it?

799
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:01,356
<i>The man who walks</i>
<i>between worlds.</i>

800
00:52:01,397 --> 00:52:05,075
    They were sent from hell
    to oversee our world.

801
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:08,555
               47.

802
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:24,796
 Is this the last thing
 you required of me?

803
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,355
      'Cause we need
      a little more time

804
00:52:26,397 --> 00:52:27,956
      than the constabulary
      will allow.

805
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:30,035
        Sweetheart, if I took
        that manner of interest
        in you,

806
00:52:30,077 --> 00:52:32,596
           you'd have no say
           in how long we'd need
           whatsoever.

807
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:40,755
        I thought I was crazy,

808
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:42,235
           but I got shot...

809
00:52:43,557 --> 00:52:44,875
                     here.

810
00:52:46,277 --> 00:52:47,635
   There's no wound.

811
00:52:47,677 --> 00:52:49,955
            No, but I was shot.

812
00:52:49,997 --> 00:52:52,035
      And this
      was standing over me.

813
00:52:52,078 --> 00:52:54,515
    And then it was
    as if it never happened.

814
00:52:54,558 --> 00:52:58,475
      I want you to cut me
      right there.

815
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:18,195
I'm not
in the habit of cutting
into defenseless women.

816
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,955
          Some big, bad outlaw.

817
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:22,875
    The Dreamwalker
    said there were some
    who could see them.

818
00:53:25,278 --> 00:53:27,555
      - That it's
      a blessing from God.
      - A blessing?

819
00:53:27,598 --> 00:53:30,196
To see the masters
who pull your strings.

820
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:37,115
     - They don't know what
     they're talking about.

           You'd rather die
           lying down or...

823
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:48,716
           up on your feet?

824
00:53:50,037 --> 00:53:51,275
           Go to hell.

      - Go on, then.

827
00:54:12,237 --> 00:54:13,676
        This would be
        the first goddamn time

828
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,235
        I've had to ask a man
        to put his hands
        on me twice.

 What does it mean?

834
00:54:46,957 --> 00:54:48,595
            That I'm not crazy
            after all.
