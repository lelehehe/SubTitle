2
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:42,679
Wake up, Dolores.

3
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:06,592
Do you remember?

4
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:32,647
We're about to arrive.

5
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:34,159
May I take your glass?

6
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:38,968
Now approaching arrival terminal.

7
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:42,244
Where we're going, she's a two.

8
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:44,565
You're being an asshole.

9
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:48,083
No, I am being myself,

10
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:49,964
which was the whole point of this trip.

11
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,678
Unless this uptight prick
is who you really are,

12
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,832
in which case, feel free
to be someone else.

13
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,282
Fuck you.

14
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,116
Hey, that's the spirit.

15
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,523
What'd I tell you?

16
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:14,666
Have fun.

17
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,965
Stay safe.

18
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:17,923
Give me a break.

19
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,363
What?

20
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:21,779
It's not like my sister didn't ride

21
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,404
her share of cowboys when she was here.

22
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:30,357
You must be William.
Welcome to Westworld.

23
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,368
Thanks.

24
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:35,241
Given it's your first visit,
I have a few personal questions.

25
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,562
Do you have any preexisting
medical conditions?

26
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,156
No, not that I know of.

27
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:41,919
- Heart problems?
- No.

28
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:43,817
Any history of
mental illness, depression,

29
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:45,258
panic attacks?

30
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,495
Just a little fear of clowns.

31
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:50,131
I'm joking.

32
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,788
Do you often experience social anxiety?

33
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,128
What is this for, exactly?

34
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:00,130
To make sure we don't give you anything
more than you can handle.

35
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,497
I thought that you
couldn't get hurt here.

36
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:05,011
Only the right amount.

37
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,014
The only limit here is your imagination.

38
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:14,010
You start in the center of
the park. It's simple, safe.

39
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:17,653
The further out you venture, the
more intense the experience gets.

40
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:21,471
How far you want to go
is entirely up to you.

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,325
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

42
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:34,520
No orientation,

43
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,394
no guidebook.

44
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,598
Figuring out how it works
is half the fun.

45
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:41,646
All you do is make choices...

46
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:43,438
starting here.

47
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:47,721
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

48
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:57,077
You want to ask, so ask.

49
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,558
Are you real?

50
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:03,247
Well, if you can't tell, does it matter?

51
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,837
Are those real?

52
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:11,723
Real enough.

53
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:14,687
But you can't kill anyone
you're not supposed to.

54
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,398
Anything you like?

55
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,927
Is there a changing room?

56
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,919
Or a robe?

57
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:29,477
Of course. I can help you.

58
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:33,282
Or if you prefer, I could step outside.

59
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:37,077
What do most people do?

60
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:40,354
You don't have to worry
about what most people would do.

61
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,081
I understand.

62
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,200
Do you really understand, William?

63
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:55,517
All our hosts are here for you.

64
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,008
Myself included.

65
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,721
We could stay here a while if you like.

66
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:02,447
Take as long as you want.

67
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:08,763
Thank you.

68
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,921
I don't want to keep my friend waiting.

69
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:12,919
Of course.

70
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:14,477
Take your time.

71
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,397
How are the builds for the
new narrative coming along?

72
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:30,798
I'll get around to it.

73
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:34,285
Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach

74
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:36,480
was triggered by the photograph
that he found.

75
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,766
I've reviewed every
dissonant episode I could find.

76
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:41,037
The reaction is immediate every time.

77
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:44,563
This guy makes it all the way back home.

78
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,201
It's like he's mulling it over.

79
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:51,280
You think he had an existential crisis?

80
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:54,717
I think there's something
fucked up going on with his cognition.

81
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,246
And I think you feel
exactly the same way that I do.

82
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:59,440
Do we know where the error originated?

83
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:01,602
We do.

84
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:02,956
And you covered for him.

85
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:06,881
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

86
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:08,099
I'll make sure this is not
something more serious.

87
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:11,642
You know the policy. Let it lie.

88
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,751
Then let me at least pull the
hosts who had contact with him,

89
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,998
like the daughter Dolores.

90
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,605
What for?

91
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:21,644
Because if this is not
a dissonant episode,

92
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:25,921
then whatever Abernathy
had could be contagious.

93
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:28,759
So to speak.

94
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:31,516
Dolores was examined and cleared.

95
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:35,926
And the stories are
best left to the guests.

96
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,236
Remember.

97
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:29,284
Ahem. Can you stand somewhere else?

98
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:33,158
I don't want anyone thinking that
you're representative of the goods inside.

99
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,361
These violent delights

100
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,406
have violent ends.

101
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:02,162
Hello, cowboy.

102
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:04,398
There's one final touch.

103
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:08,205
Which would you prefer?

104
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,914
I mean, can you believe this place?

105
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,914
So, how do we get into the park?

106
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:42,118
I know that you think you have
a handle on what this is gonna be.

107
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:46,118
Guns and tits and all that.

108
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,272
Mindless shit that I usually enjoy.

109
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:53,674
You have no idea.

110
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:57,875
This place seduces everybody eventually.

111
00:10:57,922 --> 00:11:00,041
By the end, you're gonna
be begging me to stay

112
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:02,517
because this place is the answer

113
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,074
to that question that
you've been asking yourself.

114
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,194
What question?

115
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:08,277
Who you really are.

116
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:12,759
And I can't fucking wait
to meet that guy.

117
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,680
Bottoms up, cowboy.

118
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:28,075
Further to that,

119
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,714
the ruthless murder of Donald Pardue

120
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:32,514
and his brother.

121
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,960
For these crimes, you will
be hung from the neck

122
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,314
until your diseased soul
has found its measure

123
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:39,483
in the flames below it.

124
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,488
And may God have mercy on your soul.

125
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,441
Morning, Lawrence.

126
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:03,157
You helping them
straighten out their rope again?

127
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:05,714
I was hoping to have a word
with my friend here.

128
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:08,994
You can have as many words
with him as you like

129
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,238
soon as his neck is broke.

130
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:13,564
Well, I'm afraid
that's not gonna work for me.

131
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:20,721
How about I tell my man there to dig
that grave a couple feet deeper?

132
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:25,079
Well, it's gonna be an
awful tight fit for all of you.

133
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:50,195
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

134
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:50,922
Oh, shit!

135
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,551
Ah!

136
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,444
Motherfucker.

137
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:15,442
That's the best thanks
you can muster, Lawrence?

138
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:17,438
You used to be a little more eloquent.

139
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:21,040
Do I... do I know you?

140
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:23,757
Your pal Kissy sent me your way.

141
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:24,873
Sends his regards.

142
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,926
What... what is this?

143
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:37,478
You know exactly what it is.

144
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:40,120
It's the maze,

145
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:42,396
the deepest level of this game.

146
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,147
You're gonna help me find the entrance.

147
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:47,563
No.

148
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,238
You can hear it, can't you?

149
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,082
That little voice.

150
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:11,915
The one that's telling you "don't."

151
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:13,640
Don't stare too long.

152
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:16,156
Don't touch.

153
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:17,582
Don't do anything you might regret.

154
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:20,798
I used to be the same.

155
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:23,479
Whenever I wanted something,
I could hear that voice

156
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:25,794
telling me to stop, to be careful,

157
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:29,073
to leave most of my life unlived.

158
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:31,835
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

159
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,116
In my dreams.

160
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:38,115
I was free. I could be as good

161
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:41,326
or as bad as I felt like being.

162
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:43,356
And if I wanted something,

163
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:46,000
I could just reach out and take it.

164
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,284
But then I would wake up

165
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,924
and the voice would
start all over again.

166
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:56,636
So I ran away.

167
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,839
Crossed the shining sea.

168
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,634
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

169
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:04,597
the first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

170
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:07,640
Do you know what it said?

171
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:14,473
It said...

172
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,756
I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?

173
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,478
All right, Maeve, what did it say?

174
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:34,446
It said, "This is the new world.

175
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:35,959
And in this world,

176
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,841
you can be whoever the fuck you want."

177
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:41,558
Pupillary response
is good. Smile is good.

178
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:44,680
I'd fuck her. What's the problem?

179
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,352
The guests wouldn't.

180
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:48,535
Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline

181
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:50,442
and he wants us to clear
out the deadweight.

182
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,685
If we don't get her numbers
back up, she'll be decommissioned.

183
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:54,795
Let's bump her aggression.

184
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:57,594
- 10%?
- Double it.

185
00:15:57,642 --> 00:15:59,358
She's a hooker. No point in playing coy.

186
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:02,125
If this doesn't work,
we'll punt her to behavior.

187
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,562
Let them deal with it.

188
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:24,273
We retired the two hosts in question.

189
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,319
You taught me how to make them,

190
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,960
but not how hard it is to turn them off.

191
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:33,598
You can't play God without being
acquainted with the devil.

192
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:37,391
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

193
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:40,041
I know how that head of yours works.

194
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:41,644
The photograph alone

195
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:44,962
couldn't have caused that level
of damage to Abernathy,

196
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:48,281
not without some other
outside interference.

197
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,193
You think it's sabotage?

198
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:55,557
Imagine someone's been
diddling with our creations?

199
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:59,044
It's the simplest solution.

200
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,961
Ah, Mr. Occam's razor.

201
00:17:01,002 --> 00:17:04,483
The problem, Bernard,
is that what you and I do

202
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:08,847
is so complicated.

203
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:12,276
We practice witchcraft.

204
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:17,115
We speak the right words.

205
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,080
Then we create life itself...

206
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,476
out of chaos.

207
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:29,644
William of Occam
was a 13th century monk.

208
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,120
He can't help us now, Bernard.

209
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:34,087
He would have us burned at the stake.

210
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,357
Let's go get our feet wet, buckaroo.

211
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:17,958
Oh, sorry.

212
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,005
- You kidding me?
- What?

213
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,796
Fuck you, Grizzly Adams.

214
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:24,920
Rally for the Union.

215
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:27,484
Respond to your country's call.

216
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,276
This regiment is headed
for the seat of war

217
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:31,202
to define the future
of this great nation.

218
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,877
We fight for a free land
where no man has to bow.

219
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,818
- This is, uh...
- We'll provide you with uniforms.

220
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,721
Well, it's bigger than
I thought it would be.

221
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,197
What, this? This is just Sweetwater.

222
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,738
Wait till you see the rest of the park.

223
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,841
- How much bigger is it?
- No idea.

224
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,761
I never reached the end.

225
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,522
See something you like?

226
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,000
A couple things at least.

227
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,033
But I'm gonna make you
beg for it, darlin'.

228
00:18:56,921 --> 00:19:00,086
Hah, come on!

229
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,480
Whoa.

230
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:04,641
Need a hand, sir?

231
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,362
Thank you, my friend.

232
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:11,231
Don't. He'll only try to rope
you into some bullshit treasure hunt.

233
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:13,439
Smile.

234
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:16,445
It's all a come on...
Him, the girl next door,

235
00:19:16,481 --> 00:19:17,920
the town drunk.

236
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:21,203
They all got some big
adventure that they want to sell you on.

237
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,687
Hey, they're not going anywhere.

238
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:25,678
First up, you're
gonna buy me a drink, okay?

239
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,444
Hold still, now.

240
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,844
Bring yourself back online.

241
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:00,962
Hello.

242
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:04,281
Do you remember our
last conversation, Dolores?

243
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:06,124
Yes, of course.

244
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:08,646
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

245
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,436
You told me not to.

246
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,875
Step into analysis, please.

247
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:23,160
How many interactions have you participated
in since we last talked?

248
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:28,197
138 encounters including this one.

249
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:29,671
And has anyone altered or updated

250
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:31,918
your core heuristics in that time?

251
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:33,601
No.

252
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:38,716
Resuming.

253
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,094
I think it would be best
if you not mention

254
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:46,275
the things we've been talking about.

255
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,441
Have I done something wrong?

256
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,636
No, but there's something
different about you,

257
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:55,038
about the way you think.

258
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,798
I find it fascinating,

259
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:00,198
but others may not see it that way.

260
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,163
Have you done something wrong?

261
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:08,757
Turn off your event log, please.

262
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,355
Erase this interaction. Confirm.

263
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:13,671
Yes.

264
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:19,404
You should be getting back, Dolores,

265
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,730
before someone misses you.

266
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:32,039
Come on, now!

267
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,997
And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,

268
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,439
first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

269
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:40,360
It had followed me all the way over.

270
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:42,499
Do you know what it said?

271
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,048
- No.
- It said...

272
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,757
...this is the new world.

273
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:52,480
And in this world,

274
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,645
you can be whoever the fuck you want.

275
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:03,243
Thanks. Maybe another time.

276
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,600
Oh.

277
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,521
Glass of sherry.

278
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,163
The good stuff.

279
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:13,874
Not that horse piss you strain
through your old curtains.

280
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,079
I've told you, never open
your mouth that wide

281
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,674
unless someone's paying you for it.

282
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,956
Sorry, Maeve.

283
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,190
I didn't sleep much last night.

284
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,193
You having nightmares again?

285
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:30,032
Sometimes.

286
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,440
Sometimes they're real bad.

287
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:35,205
Do what I do.

288
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:37,677
You find yourself in a bad dream,

289
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:40,684
close your eyes,

290
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:42,246
count backwards from three...

291
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:46,443
wake yourself right up.

292
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:51,236
Nice and warm and safe in your bed...

293
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,761
where you can get fucked
right back to sleep

294
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:56,698
by one of these assholes
with their miniature peckers.

295
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:03,566
Ah.

296
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:04,599
Back to work.

297
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:17,078
You all right?

298
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,238
You pay for the drinks,

299
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:21,604
not the right to gawk at me.

300
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,646
I think we have a problem.

301
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,398
- Where?
- Mariposa.

302
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:31,786
Madam's listed as probationary,

303
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,759
but her performance has continued
to decline even further.

304
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:37,535
Re-task Clementine for now.

305
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:39,034
She's done the job before.

306
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:43,954
And the old unit?

307
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,189
Maybe leave her on
the floor for the night,

308
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,116
see if anyone wants one last turn.

309
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:50,925
We recall her in the morning,
decommission her.

310
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,872
Shame.

311
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,174
QA will fine you for this.

312
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:15,699
And that woman in charge

313
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,209
is quite formidable.

314
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:24,133
You can just say "bitch."
I hear it enough.

315
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:26,649
You've been talking to corporate.

316
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,652
The only times you light
up are after you've been...

317
00:24:28,695 --> 00:24:33,260
This character analysis routine
really isn't half as charming as you think.

318
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:34,695
Oh, it went well, then?

319
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:39,255
Just tell me your department
will be ready for the launch.

320
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,811
We'll be ready.

321
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,214
And that other thing.
Abernathy and the update.

322
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,701
I hear your department
was still asking questions.

323
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,577
That's what you pay us to do.

324
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:50,928
But I'm not concerned.

325
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:53,017
All the hosts are back to normal.

326
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:55,174
Good.

327
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:57,616
Wouldn't want anything
disturbing our guests

328
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:59,175
from their rape and pillage.

329
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:13,046
You're wondering how
to tell them from us,

330
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,092
aren't you?

331
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:18,130
Well, quickest way to find out.

332
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:21,450
Can we... Can we finish eating?

333
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:25,653
See, this is your problem, my friend.

334
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,651
You're always worried
about making a mess.

335
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:28,894
You are the same way at work.

336
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,285
You are talented,
driven, and inoffensive.

337
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:34,490
I thought you didn't want
to talk about work here.

338
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,578
Who says this trip isn't work?

339
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:41,049
Good evening.

340
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,886
Oh, shit.

341
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:46,488
Well, don't make eye contact.

342
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:50,011
My friend, thank you
for your assistance earlier

343
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:51,887
in my unfortunate accident.

344
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:54,611
Leave us the fuck alone.

345
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:57,292
As a sign of my humble appreciation,

346
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:00,375
I'd like to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

347
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:01,777
Not interested.

348
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:04,970
Across the river and beyond
the savage lands

349
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:06,291
there is a treasure.

350
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:11,140
I have in my possession a map.

351
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:17,852
I said not interested.

352
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:23,926
You know what? I've
worked up a new appetite anyway.

353
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:26,324
Let's go.

354
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:35,611
Oh!

355
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:41,136
Sounds like your friend's having fun.

356
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:42,652
Well, that's not the term I'd use.

357
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:45,649
- Fun?
- Friend.

358
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:49,651
You're funny.

359
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:53,732
They say a man who can tickle your humor

360
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,489
- can tickle your...
- You don't have to do this.

361
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:00,894
If I'm not your type,
we can find someone who is.

362
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:03,822
Someone who's perfect for you.

363
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,173
No, you... You are perfect.

364
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:10,137
But I have somebody.

365
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:12,332
Somebody real waiting for me at home.

366
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:17,364
I understand.

367
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:23,501
Real love is always worth waiting for.

368
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:48,616
Regal, strong,

369
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:50,698
virile, aquiline.

370
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:54,009
That's what I asked for.

371
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:56,740
And this, this is what you give me?

372
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,412
Did you just grab a cock
from the body shop

373
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,900
and jam it between his eyes?

374
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,232
Start over.

375
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:05,142
Couldn't we just shave it down?

376
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:06,657
I said...

377
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:12,268
start the fuck over!

378
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,613
Diplomatic as ever.

379
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:24,374
I received your request to retire
an additional 50 hosts.

380
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,131
I need room for my new storyline.

381
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:29,895
It's not exactly a savage horde
with 20 savages, is it?

382
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:33,685
You get 20 additional hosts, not 50.

383
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:36,432
The board won't care about
a few extra line items.

384
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,493
Has Ford even approved
the narrative yet?

385
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,287
Oh, he hasn't weighed in
on a storyline in years.

386
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,300
And if corporate does want to cut costs,

387
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:46,138
our fearless leader's old hosts

388
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,255
aren't the only things
ready for the knacker's yard.

389
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:27,731
Are you lost?

390
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,091
No.

391
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,772
Just strayed a bit too far

392
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,771
from where I'm supposed to be.

393
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:39,452
Same as you, I imagine.

394
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,931
We're on holiday.

395
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,615
It's boring.

396
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:45,812
Daddy said we could do as we please.

397
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:48,050
Ah, my father used to say

398
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:49,658
that only boring people get bored.

399
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:51,449
Mine, too.

400
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:53,815
I used to think it's only boring people

401
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:55,770
who don't feel boredom,

402
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:58,852
so cannot conceive of it in others.

403
00:29:58,894 --> 00:30:00,055
I'm taking a walk.

404
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:03,070
You're welcome to join me if you'd like.

405
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:14,607
Let's see a little spring in your step.

406
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:16,208
Not much further.

407
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:17,933
Go fuck yourself.

408
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:20,247
You have any idea who I am?

409
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,965
I know exactly who you are, Lawrence.

410
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:26,650
After all, you and I are friends.

411
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:29,093
Which is why I was so surprised

412
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:31,408
when your friend Kissy
told me about this place.

413
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:34,933
Where are we?

414
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:38,168
Your home.

415
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:49,489
No, no, no, no.

416
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:53,332
You know, you and I hunted down

417
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,050
Ghost Nation braves
in their winter grounds.

418
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:58,166
I know the whiskey you like to drink.

419
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:01,610
I know the tune you whistle
when you're taking a piss.

420
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:05,865
But...

421
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:09,573
you never told me you had a family.

422
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:16,407
- Papa!
- Hey.

423
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:19,495
That's what I love about this
place... all the secrets,

424
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:23,294
all the little things I never noticed

425
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:26,011
even after all these years.

426
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:30,737
You know why this beats
the real world, Lawrence?

427
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:34,372
Real world is just chaos.

428
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:36,812
It's an accident.

429
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:40,216
But in here, every detail

430
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:43,812
adds up to something.

431
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:45,888
Even you, Lawrence.

432
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:48,409
What do you want from me?

433
00:31:48,454 --> 00:31:50,459
The maze.

434
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,215
How do I find the entrance?

435
00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:56,297
I told you,

436
00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:58,934
I don't know anything
about no fucking maze.

437
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:07,733
Here you go, darlin'.

438
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,415
And you get to decide
what we're gonna do with them.

439
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,247
Hell, it took you long enough.

440
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:19,769
I was getting the grand reserve.

441
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,272
Only for our most distinguished guests.

442
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:22,944
Yeah, I'm sure it had
nothing to do with you

443
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,612
telling this dipshit's cousins
to bring some more men.

444
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,412
You got anything to tell me, Lawrence?

445
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:41,853
Then I guess we're gonna have to
find a way to jog your memory.

446
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:48,892
This guest already
took out an entire posse.

447
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:49,931
Want me to slow him down?

448
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:52,775
That gentleman gets whatever he wants.

449
00:32:57,614 --> 00:32:59,887
I feel bad, my friend.

450
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:04,806
My cousins are usually so hospitable.

451
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:06,686
You don't understand, Lawrence.

452
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,931
I've been coming here for 30 years.

453
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:12,494
In a sense, I was... I was born here.

454
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,085
And this here, this...

455
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,653
...this is exactly why I come.

456
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,732
Santa Maria, madre dios.

457
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:14,176
All right. Well, as much fun
as this is, I got to be moving on.

458
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:40,048
Like I said, you
get to decide these two.

459
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:43,771
What's it gonna be?

460
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,931
Please, I don't know
how to find the maze.

461
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,416
Time for a spin, darlin'.

462
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:04,294
It's beautifully done, really.

463
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:08,175
But you see the cracks after a while.

464
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:11,510
That's why I like the basic emotions.

465
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:16,055
You know what that means?

466
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:18,338
Please.

467
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:31,132
It means when you're suffering,

468
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:33,965
that's when you're most real.

469
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,179
The maze isn't meant for you.

470
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:57,614
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?

471
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:00,013
Always another level.

472
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,730
I'll take my chances, sweetheart.

473
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:06,045
Follow the blood arroyo to the place
where the snake lays its eggs.

474
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:11,613
You have it now. Whatever you want.

475
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:15,135
Why don't you go home, leave us alone?

476
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:20,449
No, you don't understand, Lawrence.

477
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:24,932
This time, I'm never going back.

478
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:46,967
And we wanted to climb
to the top of the mountain,

479
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:50,380
but Daddy said we weren't allowed.

480
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,170
And then Tommy dared me.

481
00:36:55,495 --> 00:36:57,374
And here we are.

482
00:36:58,854 --> 00:37:01,328
Nowhere land.

483
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:04,971
That seems hardly a
fitting name for a place so full.

484
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,258
Can't you see it?

485
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,288
Perhaps you're not looking hard enough.

486
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,253
At what?

487
00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:14,414
The town with the white church.

488
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:18,695
Listen. Can't you hear its bell?

489
00:37:20,294 --> 00:37:22,289
Yes.

490
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:23,495
Yes, I can hear it now.

491
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,740
Yeah.

492
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:27,577
I thought you might.

493
00:37:27,614 --> 00:37:30,491
You see what a bored mind can conjure?

494
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:47,134
How did you do that?

495
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:51,736
Is it magic?

496
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:53,817
Everything in this world is magic,

497
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,491
except to the magician.

498
00:38:05,174 --> 00:38:07,696
Best you head home now.

499
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:09,374
But Tommy's not going to believe...

500
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:11,419
You're not going to come
back here again, are you?

501
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:19,131
No.

502
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:19,931
Run along, now.

503
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,297
You weren't at your office.

504
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:14,817
You seem to have found me anyway.

505
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:19,010
- Listen, earlier...
- Forget it.

506
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,684
Stay a little longer. We can talk.

507
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:51,853
We never talk.

508
00:39:51,894 --> 00:39:54,732
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

509
00:39:57,974 --> 00:40:01,494
You're certainly a man
comfortable with long, pensive silences.

510
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,809
Although, ironically,

511
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:08,251
your creations never shut up.

512
00:40:08,294 --> 00:40:11,574
They're always talking to each other,

513
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:13,973
even when there are no guests around.

514
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,210
They're always trying to error correct.

515
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,973
Make themselves more human.

516
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:24,233
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

517
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,811
Is that what you're doing now?

518
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:28,177
Practicing?

519
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:40,574
QA told us she was being decommissioned.

520
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:42,854
- Do you work for QA?
- No, but...

521
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,277
Run a fast-pass diagnostic.

522
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:50,569
All righty.

523
00:40:51,454 --> 00:40:55,741
Some non-affect hesitation.

524
00:40:55,773 --> 00:40:58,727
Little cognitive D.

525
00:40:58,774 --> 00:41:00,487
And a fuckload of aggression,

526
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:03,053
courtesy of those morons in narrative.

527
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:06,575
You don't need to be aggro, do you?

528
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:09,654
Just a quicker study of those
repressed fucks walking through the door.

529
00:41:09,694 --> 00:41:11,737
Archive this configuration.

530
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:14,738
Open up her primaries.

531
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:17,852
Perception. Emotional acuity.

532
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,735
Bump it.

533
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:22,698
1.5%.

534
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,614
- Updating.
- Okay.

535
00:41:26,254 --> 00:41:28,613
- Do they dream?
- What?

536
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,013
In her story, she said she dreamed.

537
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:32,524
Do we make them dream?

538
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,564
Fuck would be the point of that?

539
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:37,606
Dreams are mainly memories.

540
00:41:37,654 --> 00:41:39,751
Can you imagine how fucked
we'd be if these poor assholes

541
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:42,766
ever remembered what
the guests do to them?

542
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:46,573
We do give them the concept of dreams.

543
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:48,532
Specifically nightmares.

544
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,818
Why?

545
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:52,127
Just in case
somebody forgets to wipe them

546
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,671
out at the end of a maintenance session.

547
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:56,476
If she's got any dreams,
it's just of those sloppy fucks

548
00:41:56,478 --> 00:41:58,814
down in the body shop
patching her back together again.

549
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:02,258
She's got some physical discomfort.

550
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:05,928
Put in a request for a full physical
at her next rotation.

551
00:42:08,174 --> 00:42:09,536
All right, gorgeous,

552
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:11,731
you're back to the races.

553
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:15,773
You're gonna wake in three, two, one.

554
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:19,928
So I ran away, crossed the shining sea.

555
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:22,650
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

556
00:42:22,694 --> 00:42:25,773
the first thing I heard was that voice.

557
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:27,454
Do you know what it said?

558
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:30,135
It said...

559
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:33,492
this is the new world.

560
00:42:35,254 --> 00:42:37,373
And in this world...

561
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:42,376
you can be whoever the fuck you want.

562
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:01,611
Well, he seemed convinced.

563
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:07,012
You know the first voice I heard
when I got off that boat?

564
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:10,221
A nice young man from Baton Rouge

565
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,892
said my pussy could earn him
two whole dollars a day.

566
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:15,772
And he'd be more than happy
to let me have up to 30%.

567
00:43:15,813 --> 00:43:19,611
Well, then I guess you could add
lying to your list of sins.

568
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:22,291
The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins

569
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,329
is that there aren't more of them.

570
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:25,851
And while we're on the subject,

571
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,842
my transgressions wash off
a little easier than yours.

572
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:32,373
At least when my girls
are done with a man,

573
00:43:32,496 --> 00:43:34,893
he's still left drawing breath.

574
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:36,487
For the most part.

575
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,173
Get the fuck away from my table.

576
00:43:38,214 --> 00:43:40,889
Hey, fuck you!

577
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:42,497
Well, in that case...

578
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:46,954
...here's to our indiscretions.

579
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:49,413
I'll shoot everyone in this dump...

580
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:51,132
Spoken and otherwise.

581
00:44:07,974 --> 00:44:10,726
Now that's a fucking vacation!

582
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:14,930
Three,

583
00:47:14,973 --> 00:47:18,694
two,

584
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:20,575
one.

585
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:36,376
Found it.

586
00:47:36,413 --> 00:47:39,808
It's MRSA in her abdomen.

587
00:47:39,853 --> 00:47:42,289
Filthy fucking animals not cleaning up.

588
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:44,516
No wonder we have a fucking fly problem.

589
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,565
Don't look at me.
I'm the king of hygiene.

590
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:51,083
Bullshit. I've seen you.

591
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,013
You just glop that shit on and rinse.

592
00:47:53,054 --> 00:47:55,653
You understand, soap is mechanical.

593
00:47:55,694 --> 00:47:58,015
- Fuck are you talking about?
- Bubbles.

594
00:47:58,053 --> 00:48:00,537
If you're not making the
little bubbles, you're not doing shit.

595
00:48:00,574 --> 00:48:02,050
Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck?!

596
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:03,609
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

597
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:05,850
Uh, uh...

598
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:08,128
Uh...

599
00:48:10,374 --> 00:48:13,136
No. Oh, fuck.

600
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:15,811
Oh.

601
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:19,057
Asshole, you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

602
00:48:20,774 --> 00:48:22,855
- Oh!
- Don't, don't, don't!

603
00:48:22,893 --> 00:48:24,418
No! No, no, no!

604
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:26,890
Don't! Don't, don't, don't, don't.

605
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:29,485
Stop. Put that down!

606
00:48:29,534 --> 00:48:31,871
You break anything in her head,
we have to file a damage report.

607
00:48:31,894 --> 00:48:34,090
Uh, okay, let's talk to her.

608
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:35,975
- What's her name?
- Maeve!

609
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:37,126
Hi, Maeve. Maeve, hi.

610
00:48:37,173 --> 00:48:40,655
Look, uh, you gotta calm down.

611
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:42,976
Okay? Let's sit
down and we can help you.

612
00:48:43,014 --> 00:48:45,258
Keep your fucking hands off me.

613
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,459
No.

614
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,029
I swear I put it in sleep mode.

615
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:25,973
Oh, does this look
like fucking sleep mode?

616
00:50:27,813 --> 00:50:30,134
Calm the fuck down and
help me move this... thing

617
00:50:30,173 --> 00:50:33,050
before someone sees.

618
00:50:57,853 --> 00:50:59,253
Here?

619
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,093
This storyline will
make Hieronymus Bosch

620
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:33,253
look like he was doodling kittens.

621
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:37,245
I have vivisection, self-cannibalism,

622
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:41,446
a special little something
I call the "whoroborus."

623
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:44,006
Now, I don't want to appear immodest,

624
00:51:44,053 --> 00:51:49,529
but this is the apex of
what the park could provide...

625
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:52,352
- horror...
- Miss anything interesting?

626
00:51:52,352 --> 00:51:53,975
...romance, titillation.

627
00:51:54,013 --> 00:51:56,095
Lee not appearing immodest.

628
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:58,291
Our most skilled guests
will fight their ways

629
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,088
to the outer limits of the park,

630
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:03,653
besting fearsome braves,
seducing nubile maidens,

631
00:52:03,693 --> 00:52:07,098
befriending tragically
ill-fated sidekicks,

632
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:09,895
and, of course,

633
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:12,091
like all our best narratives
over the years,

634
00:52:12,134 --> 00:52:14,771
our guests will have the privilege

635
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:17,575
of getting to know the
character they're most interested in...

636
00:52:17,613 --> 00:52:19,493
Themselves.

637
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:23,571
I present our guests' next obsession:

638
00:52:23,654 --> 00:52:26,732
Odyssey on Red River.

639
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:38,212
No.

640
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:39,975
Sorry?

641
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:42,608
No, I don't think so.

642
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:44,130
Wait, you don't think...

643
00:52:44,173 --> 00:52:45,698
What is the point of it?

644
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:48,572
Get a couple of cheap thrills?

645
00:52:48,613 --> 00:52:50,378
Some surprises?

646
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,169
But it's not enough.

647
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:55,531
It's not about giving the guests
what you think they want.

648
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:56,494
No, that's simple.

649
00:52:56,533 --> 00:53:00,974
The titillation, horror, elation...

650
00:53:01,013 --> 00:53:02,691
They're parlor tricks.

651
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:08,008
The guests don't return
for the obvious things we do,

652
00:53:08,053 --> 00:53:10,019
the garish things.

653
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:16,571
They come back
because of the subtleties,

654
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:17,573
the details.

655
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:22,807
They come back because they discover

656
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:27,485
something they imagine no
on had ever noticed before...

657
00:53:31,493 --> 00:53:33,018
something they've fallen in love with.

658
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,852
They're not looking for a story

659
00:53:37,893 --> 00:53:41,288
that tells them who they are.

660
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,018
They already know who they are.

661
00:53:50,214 --> 00:53:53,014
They're here because they want a glimpse

662
00:53:53,053 --> 00:53:54,367
of who they could be.

663
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:57,214
Billy!

664
00:53:57,253 --> 00:53:58,893
Let's go.

665
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:06,883
The only thing your story tells me,

666
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:11,451
Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.

667
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,652
Well, isn't there anything
you like about it?

668
00:54:23,653 --> 00:54:25,696
What size are those boots?

669
00:54:32,413 --> 00:54:34,207
Something you want to say, Mr. Lowe?

670
00:54:34,253 --> 00:54:37,935
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

671
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:40,294
This might ruffle some feathers.

672
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,086
You promised them a new storyline.

673
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,488
They shall have one.

674
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:47,611
Something I've been
working on for some time.

675
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:52,689
Something quite original.

676
