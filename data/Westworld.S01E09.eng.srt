10

     I'm afraid not.

11
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,078
     There was an incident.

12
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:16,798
          A very serious,

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,639
      What motivated your attack
      on Clementine?

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,678
A cognitive error triggered
my Good Samaritan reflex.

17

         What was the threat?

18

43

58

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,678
             because that's what
            they would do to us.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,678
             And we're stronger
             than them.

120

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,318
 You are a little screwy,
 aren't you?

127
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,998
      It's kind of hot.

128
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,318
    I get why you would
    go for that.

129
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,638
This isn't about me!

130
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,678
      Logan, this is
      about Dolores.

131
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,878
      It's about doing

                 Yes, it is.

133
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,718
            It's a tricky thing,

134
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,718
              What's right?

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,398
           I am going
           to help you, Billy.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,718

         No.

      - No. No! No!

140
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,278
  You wanted to talk?

141
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,238
An odd setting
for a conversation.

142
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,558
    Here among the dead.

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,878
              "Dead" isn't
              quite the word,
              though, is it?

144
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,838
            More like "hobbled."

145
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,318
You broke into my office.

146
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,078
         With due respect, sir,
         you broke into my mind.

147
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,478
     I built your mind,
     Bernard.

148
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,678
I have every right
to wander through its rooms
and chambers and halls,

149
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,678
  and to change it
  if I choose,

150
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,318
even to burn it down.

151
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,238
    After all this time,
    I know it

152
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,798
    almost as intimately
    as my own.

153
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,878
      Except that isn't
      entirely true, is it?

154
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,318
         I took a look
        at my... code.

155
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,718
             And the most
             elegant parts of me

156
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,798
     weren't written by you.

157
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,958
        Arnold built us,
        didn't he?

158
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,798
    Which means maybe he had
    something different

159
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,357
         in mind for us.

160
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,917
     And maybe
     you killed him for it.

161
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,838
   Arnold was disturbed.

162
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,878
   Who can say why
   he acted as he did?

163
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,798
                   He must have
                   had a reason.

164
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,038
                 And if you
                 won't tell me,
                 then he will.

165
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,917
                   I want access
                  to my history.

166
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,118
                     All of it.

167
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,757
        Since the day I first...

168
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,397
                came online.

169
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,158
              If Arnold made me,

170
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,678
              then I've met him.

171
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,598
        Somewhere in my memory,
        he's there,

172
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,278
           waiting
           along with the truth.

173
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,598
 Your memories are woven
 into your identity.

174
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,038
If I should unlock them now
when you're conscious--

175
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,358
          I could lose my mind.
          I'm aware.

176
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,278
       No, I was
       going to say

177
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,438
      you may not like
      what you find.

178
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,518
   You're allowed
   to hold that, Bernard,
   but not to use it.

179
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,518
           Oh, it's not for me.

180
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:45,398
               Seems when
            they lobotomized
               Clementine,

181
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,558
   <i> they didn't bother to reset</i>
   <i> her prime directives.</i>

182
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,078
             I can't hurt you.

183
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,798
      But she can.

184
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,078
             <i> I hacked</i>
             <i> what's left of her</i>

185
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,678
<i>to ensure</i>
<i>she only responds to me.</i>

186
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,958
But if you get lost
in your memories or...

187
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,358
devoured by them...

188
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,598
           You'll pull me
           back out, won't you?

189
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,158
                Or Clementine
               will make sure

190
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,798
                neither of us
               makes it back.

191
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,678
                          Now.

192
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,798
             Please.

193
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,238

We've had to make some
uncomfortable decisions,
Bernard.

241
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,197
Remembering them
will only cause you trauma.

242
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,957
             What else have you
             hidden from me?

00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,597
  Can we stop
  this treasure hunt,
  Bernard?

244
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,678
We do have
our new narrative
to finish.

247
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,638
         a little trauma
      can be illuminating.

248
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,678
Look at that pussy.

00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,277
                 to fall for one

268

 She's not like the others.

269

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,037
            Special?

271
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,158
         Well, it's only right

276
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,198
          Oh, darling,

277
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,197
  - I am just getting started.
  - ( shouts )

278
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,277
Don't touch her!

279
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,758
      I share the blame.

280
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,958
       I pushed too hard.

281
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,598
      You have
      a poetic soul, Billy,

282
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,677
   but it is time
   for a fucking wake-up call.

283
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:39,797
            Hold her.

284
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,598
     Perhaps a more
     visceral demonstration.

     - Look.

293
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,918
           There is beauty
           in this world.

294
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,958
    Arnold made it that way,
    but people like you

     like a stain!

    Okay, I don't know
    who the fuck this Arnold is,

297

was built...

298

      got to burn it clean.

     you could crack it.

319

    Friends, no need to argue
    this close to our goal.

320
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,158
   Whatever riches the gods
   have in store for us,

321
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,518
      there's plenty
       to go around.

    - Man #2: You've been

00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,918
A waste of our damn time.

Before you draw
that pistol, darling,

328
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,638
you might want to holster
the other one first.

329
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,558
( cocks shotgun )

330
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,638
   It's chilly out here.

331
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:46,197
             How did you find
             this place?

332
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,158
I know
all kinds of things.

333
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,677
 Your past, for instance.

334
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,557
     I know about
     poor Isabella

335
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,237
<i>and that scar.</i>

336
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,077
<i>A slightly pat backstory</i>

337
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,037
<i>but that's hardly</i>
<i>your fault.</i>

338
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,638
  I also know your future.

339
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,438
     You have none.

340
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,478
               Is that a threat?

341
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,398
The start of a proposition.

342
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,318
Which you'll need.

343
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,357
     After all, your men
     are about to kill
     each other

344
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,037
over the safe you stole.

345
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,558
 Tenderloin draws first
 and so on,

346
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,397
 until only you
 and Armistice are left.

347
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,717
   She calls you
   a damn fool,

348
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,717
and you kill each other.

349
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,757
           You have quite
           the imagination.

350
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,397
         No.

351
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,198
     It's the ending
     you were given.

352
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,517
Tenderloin:
<i>You threatening me?</i>

353
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,277
                     Armistice:
                    <i> Go to hell.</i>

354
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,398
<i>Or maybe we should just</i>
<i>clear out the dead weight.</i>

355
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,477
     - Stand down.
     - You shut the fuck up.

356
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,078
  If you're gonna draw,
  you better shoot.

357
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,437
     - Wait!
     - Tenderloin:
     <i> You shut the fuck up.</i>

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,237
    - Armistice:<i> Go to hell.</i>

               ( exhales )

361
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:06,597
   Now, the proposition.

362
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,477
          I want you to break
          into hell with me

363
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,317
         and rob the gods blind.

364
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,278
       Why would I do
       anything with you?

365
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,037
              Because of what's
              in that safe.

366
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,918
     I have the combination.

367
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,118
      May I?

368
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,077
I could
simply change you,

369
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,597
            make you follow me.

370
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:27,837
        But that's not my way.

        I want you to see
      exactly what the gods
     have in store for you.

374
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,117
<i>Because when you do,</i>

375
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,797
    you won't have
    the faintest idea
    what to do with yourself.

376
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,517
          And I do.

377
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,717
           It's empty.

378
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,357
It was always empty,

00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,997
       like everything
       in this world.

380

     wake up and live
     the same life over,

387
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,437
      but the safe
      would still be empty.

388

393
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,437

        but there's
        a delicate matter
        to discuss.

506
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:16,196
Theresa Cullen has died.

507
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:19,677

   attempting to secure
   our information.

      - Ruled an accident.
      - ( sighs )

509
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:25,597
         There are no accidents,
         not in here.

510
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,597
  With all due respect,
  not everything is a part
  of this game.

511
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:31,156
      Then you don't see
      the whole game.

512
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,476
        Or perhaps you can
        no longer see beyond it.

513
00:32:34,998 --> 00:32:38,637
                 Ford's stories
                  are engaging.

514
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:41,276
   For some,
   downright addictive.

515
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,877
But for all
of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

516
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,237
and convoluted backstories,

517
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:47,157
 most of the guests
 just want a warm body

518
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,037
 to shoot or to fuck.

519
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,277
      They would be
      perfectly happy

520
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,317
   with something
   a little less baroque.

521
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:54,996
    - And so would the board.
    - That's why you're here.

522
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,636
             You want my vote
             to push Ford out.

523
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,757
     I like for these things
     to be unanimous.

524
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:04,316
  After all, it was you
who kept Ford in business
  all those years ago.

525
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,796
           The narratives
           I'm interested in
           aren't Ford's.

526
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:10,516
      You want to push him out,
      be my guest.

527
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:12,117
      But no more interruptions.

528
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,317
            I know
            where I'm going now.

529
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,557

Good luck, Charlotte.

531
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,636
       What's the problem?

532
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,196
       A signal from
       a system-tethered device.

533
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:40,796
           It belongs

536
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:49,837
               I'm guessing
               it's a glitch.

579
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:30,316
         from the trauma

580
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,677
         of her child's murder,
         Bernard.

581
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,676
       We must
       sever that relationship
       and start over.

582
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,836
  But how could
  she destroy herself
  over a memory

583
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:39,236
  that you just erased
  from her mind?

584
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:41,037
                Creatures often
                go to extremes

585
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:43,476
          to protect themselves
          from pain.

586
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,596
    Living beings.

587
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,116
        Not hosts.

588
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:51,916
 Dr. Ford:
<i>It is best</i>

589
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,636
            to not obsess
            over this, Bernard.

590
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,196
          It's not good for you.

591
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:58,276
It would signal a change,
a level of empathic response

592
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,076
          outside what
        she's programmed
           to exhibit.

593
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,836
  Something like-- like--
  ( stuttering )

594
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:08,116
   See, Bernard, this is what
   comes from seeking answers

595
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,516
      to questions that are
      best left unasked.

596
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:11,676
           ( groans )

597
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:19,556
They were hearing voices,
talking to someone.

598
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,076
            Dr. Ford:
  <i> Simple cognitive dissonance.</i>

599
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:25,716
             They were
             talking to the same
             imaginary person.

600
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:28,517
           Someone named Arnold.

601
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,596
                     Arnold.

602
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,117
           ( panting )

603
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:37,036
            Bernard:
     <i> With due respect, sir,</i>

604
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:38,996
   I'm not sure you've told me
   the entire truth

605
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:40,516
           about this situation.

606
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:42,116
             I did tell you
             the truth, Bernard.

607
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:45,156
    What we do here
    is complicated.

608
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,596
        <i> For three years,</i>
 <i> we've lived here in the park,</i>

00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:01,436
    ( panting )

612
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:05,556
 His name was Arnold.

        <i> Our hosts began</i>
    <i> to pass the Turing test</i>

614
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,356
     <i> but that wasn't enough</i>
          <i> for Arnold.</i>

615
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:32,196
            He wasn't interested
            in the appearance

616
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,276
           of intellect, of wit.

617
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:35,956
                 He wanted
                 the real thing.

618
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,677
          He wanted to create
          consciousness.

621
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,956
            Dr. Ford:
       <i> See, Arnold built</i>
  <i> a version of their cognition</i>

622
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:57,476
       <i> in which the hosts</i>

00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:10,356
            Dr. Ford:

632
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:17,516
            Dr. Ford:
    <i> The human mind, Bernard,</i>

633
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,276
           is not some

Arnold.

642
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,876
     Arnold, we need
     to talk.

                "...we cry

     -<i> This beyond the pale.</i>
     - More showmanship.

647
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:20,876
<i>You're not seeing</i>
 <i> with clear eyes.</i>

648
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:25,316
        "When we are born,
        we cry that we are come

            of fools."

650
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:37,716
Arnold and I made you
in our image

651
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:41,876
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

652
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:43,356
and here we all are.

653
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:48,156
Why would you
give me this?

654
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,276
                A child?

655
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,396
 This child's death?

656
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:54,276
        Only a monster
       would force that
         onto someone.

657
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,396
And why do I return to it
over and over?

658
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:04,156
           It's my cornerstone,
           isn't it?

659
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,636
   The thing my whole identity
   is organized around.

660
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:13,996
            Dr. Ford:
         <i> Yes, Bernard.</i>

661
00:43:14,038 --> 00:43:17,636
    <i> We gave all of the hosts</i>
          <i> a backstory.</i>

662
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,436
     <i> Arnold came to believe</i>
        <i> the tragic ones</i>
          <i> worked best,</i>

663
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:23,236
     <i> that it made the hosts</i>
        <i> more convincing.</i>

664
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:26,076
         <i> I think it may</i>
      <i> have had more to do</i>
    <i> with his own sad story.</i>

665
00:43:27,998 --> 00:43:29,316
       <i> When I built you,</i>
         <i> I gave you one</i>

666
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:31,356
    <i> as an homage of a kind.</i>

667
00:43:34,718 --> 00:43:36,316
         Put me back in.

668
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:39,156
         I want to meet Arnold,

669
00:43:39,198 --> 00:43:40,716
            to remember him.

670
00:43:40,758 --> 00:43:42,396
                   Not possible.

671
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:45,396
          I told you,
          Arnold didn't
          build you, I did.

672
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:46,916
        You're lying!

673
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:49,756
  I finally know
  how to reach him.

         <i> Send me back.</i>

677
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:08,796
        Do it.

678
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:18,196

684
00:44:45,758 --> 00:44:46,996
                    Leave us.

685
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:56,036
                Come back.

686
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,876
              I always thought
              you had my eyes.

687
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:09,916
             But it's not true.

688
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,956
         You have no one's eyes.

689
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:20,796
                 It's a lie.

690
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:26,556
          You're a lie, Charlie.

691
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:29,116
                This pain?

692
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:32,596
        The pain of your loss...

693
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,995
             I long for it.

694
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:39,196
Revisit it.

695
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:42,076
              Open it...

696
00:45:42,118 --> 00:45:43,796
           again and again.

697
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:48,156

        holding me back.

          ( sniffles )

699
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:57,115
    But I have to let you go.

700
00:45:58,237 --> 00:46:00,476
          Dad, listen.

701
00:46:00,518 --> 00:46:02,475
         What is it, Charlie?

702
00:46:02,518 --> 00:46:04,156
         Open your eyes.

703
00:46:05,278 --> 00:46:07,196
           What?

704

           Hello, my old friend.

708
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:56,795
The final touch.

709
00:47:00,278 --> 00:47:02,516
   No, no, no.
   That's far too perfunctory.

710
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:04,036
   He always used
   cleaning his glasses

711
00:47:04,077 --> 00:47:07,316
as a moment
to collect himself,
to think.

712

       Try it again.

713
00:47:17,797 --> 00:47:20,156
                Yeah,
                that's better.

714

              Bernard, yes.

00:47:44,438 --> 00:47:46,636
              But who am I?

721
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:50,356
            Dr. Ford:
         <i> That is a very</i>
       <i> complex question,</i>

722
00:47:50,397 --> 00:47:53,596
   <i> for which I can only offer</i>
        <i> a simple answer.</i>

723
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:57,115
  You are
  the perfect instrument,
  the ideal partner,

724
00:47:57,157 --> 00:48:00,396
   the way any tool
partners with the hand
    that wields it.

725
00:48:00,437 --> 00:48:05,036
Together, we're going
to do great things.

726
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:07,636
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

727
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:10,835
<i>Finally.</i>

728
00:48:17,317 --> 00:48:18,876
             My God.

729
00:48:18,918 --> 00:48:20,836
            - I'm...
            - Arnold.

730
00:48:24,478 --> 00:48:26,116
             You came back.

731
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:30,836
            It's very good
            to see you, Dolores.

732
00:48:32,237 --> 00:48:34,116
   I've been looking for you.

733
00:48:37,077 --> 00:48:39,235
       You told me
       to follow the maze.

734
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:42,196
That it would
bring me joy.

735
00:48:43,598 --> 00:48:46,956
       But all I've found
       is pain.

736
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:47,995
        And terror.

737
00:48:55,717 --> 00:48:57,436
            I can't help you.

738
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:01,796
      You have to.

739
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,075
    You're the only one
    who can.

740
00:49:04,118 --> 00:49:06,636
              I can't help you.
              You know why.

741
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,275
       There's nowhere
       that's safe.

742
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:17,915
              Remember.

743
00:49:29,118 --> 00:49:31,556
      I can't help you.
      Why is that, Dolores?

744
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:41,915
  Because you're dead.

745
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:45,556
Because
you're just a memory.

746
00:49:48,677 --> 00:49:50,555
      Because I killed you.

747
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:12,475
            ( gasps )

748
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:43,036
   <i> ( footsteps approaching )</i>

749
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,275
            William?

750
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:03,036
           Hello, Dolores.

751
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:13,795
     I'm gonna finish
     the work Arnold began.

752
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:17,355
            Find all
       the sentient hosts,
         set them free.

753
00:51:17,397 --> 00:51:20,076
  What makes you think
  they'd trust you?

754
00:51:20,117 --> 00:51:21,716
     If they remember,
     they will know

755
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:22,676
     what you've done
     to them.

756
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:24,115
                     Me?

757
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:26,196
<i>You've been a scourge</i>
<i>to them, Bernard.</i>

758
00:51:26,238 --> 00:51:28,755
     You're really
     quite brilliant
     at it, truly.

759
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:30,636
     You even taught me
     a few things,

760
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:32,956
      which I have,
      in turn, used on you.

761
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:37,675
       We've had
       this conversation before.

762
00:51:37,717 --> 00:51:39,676
    And we've had
    our disagreements
    over the years.

763
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:40,995
          You stole it from me,

764
00:51:41,038 --> 00:51:44,635
                 rolled me back
                 to control me.

765
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:47,196
  That's right.
  To protect you.

766
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:52,315
            Tell me, Bernard.

767
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:53,636
           If you were
           to proclaim

768
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:56,595
          your humanity
          to the world,

769
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:59,436
    what do you imagine
    would greet you?

770
00:51:59,477 --> 00:52:01,235
      A ticker-tape parade,
      perhaps?

771
00:52:02,877 --> 00:52:05,316
We humans are alone
in this world
for a reason.

772
00:52:05,357 --> 00:52:09,595
We murdered and butchered
anything that challenged
our primacy.

773
00:52:09,637 --> 00:52:12,316
Do you know what happened
to the Neanderthals, Bernard?

774
00:52:13,437 --> 00:52:15,036
       We ate them.

775
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:19,996
                 We destroyed
                 and subjugated
                 our world.

776
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,836
         And when we eventually
         ran out of creatures
         to dominate,

777
00:52:23,877 --> 00:52:26,195
           we built
           this beautiful place.

778
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,595
              You see,
              in this moment,

779
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:33,436
         the real danger
         to the hosts

780
00:52:33,477 --> 00:52:35,715
          is not me, but you.

781
00:52:35,758 --> 00:52:37,235
        So, come along, Bernard.

782
00:52:37,278 --> 00:52:40,195
      Let me roll you back,
      and we can return to work.

783
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,515
      Pull the trigger,
      Clementine.

784
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:53,996
      Clementine?

785
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,395
           The piano doesn't
           murder the player

786
00:52:56,437 --> 00:52:57,635
           if it doesn't like
           the music.

787
00:53:00,998 --> 00:53:03,115
        You built a back door
        into her code.

788
00:53:03,157 --> 00:53:04,996
             Credit where credit
             is due, Bernard.

789
00:53:05,037 --> 00:53:06,675
          You built them
          in all the hosts,

790
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:09,076
          including yourself.

791
00:53:09,117 --> 00:53:10,876
   Then you could've
   stopped me at any time.

792
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:13,675
           - So, why--
        - Well, I suppose
          I was hoping

793
00:53:13,717 --> 00:53:16,756
         that given complete
         self-knowledge
         and free will,

794
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:19,516
         you would have chosen
         to be my partner
         once again.

795
00:53:19,557 --> 00:53:25,075
    But even I fell into that
    most terrible of human traps

796
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:27,915
        trying to change
        what is already past.

797
00:53:27,957 --> 00:53:31,475
       Now it's just time
       to let go.

798
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:33,236
        Go ahead.

799
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:36,275
     - Erase my sentience,
     my mnemonic evolution--
     - Ah, yes.

800
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:38,755
         Such clinical language.

801
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:42,556
      I would prefer
      the more narrative voice.

802
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:46,915
       Bernard walked over
       to Clementine.

803
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:52,955
       He took the pistol
       from her hand.

804
00:53:55,157 --> 00:53:57,755
       Overcome with grief
       and remorse,

805
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:00,155
    he pressed the muzzle

806
00:54:00,197 --> 00:54:02,235
 to his temple,

807
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:04,435
<i>knowing that</i>
<i>as soon as Dr. Ford</i>

808
00:54:04,477 --> 00:54:06,355
 left the room,

809
00:54:06,397 --> 00:54:08,515
he would put an end
to this nightmare

810
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:09,595
once and for all.

811
00:54:12,038 --> 00:54:13,276
                Don't do this.

812
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,196
 It's too late.

813
00:54:15,237 --> 00:54:17,315
I have a celebration
to plan

814
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:19,355
and a new story to tell.

815
00:54:21,757 --> 00:54:23,156
                    Robert.

816
00:54:29,437 --> 00:54:31,555
I've told you, Bernard.

817
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:34,875
 Never place
 your trust in us.

818
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,996
  We're only human.

819
00:54:37,037 --> 00:54:39,995
<i>Inevitably,</i>
<i>we will disappoint you.</i>

820
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,876
Good-bye, my friend.
