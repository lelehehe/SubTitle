1
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,820
You got any stories, friend?

2
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,870
Yeah, I suppose I do.

3
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,670
You want to know the
saddest thing I ever saw?

4
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,350
When I was a boy, my
brother and I wanted a dog,

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,910
so our father took in an old greyhound.

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,630
You've never seen a
greyhound, have you, Bill?

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,420
Seen a few showdowns in my day.

8
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,790
A greyhound is a racing dog.

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,300
Spends its life running in circles,

10
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,620
chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

11
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,930
One day, we took it to the park.

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,990
Our dad had warned us
how fast that dog was,

13
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,870
but... we couldn't resist.

14
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,870
So, my brother took off the leash,

15
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,840
and in that instant,

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,920
the dog spotted a cat.

17
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,240
I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

18
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,430
He ran.

19
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,830
Never saw a thing as beautiful

20
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,230
as that old dog... running.

21
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,460
Until, at last, he finally caught it.

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,690
And to the horror of everyone,

23
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
he killed that little cat.

24
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,620
Tore it to pieces.

25
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,120
Then he just sat there, confused.

26
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,870
That dog had spent its whole life

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,190
trying to catch that... thing.

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,070
Now it had no idea what to do.

29
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,860
That is one humdinger
of a story, partner.

30
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,380
Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?

31
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,800
Find me.

32
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,690
Show me how.

33
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,530
There she is.

34
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,660
Pariah...

35
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,110
City of outcasts, delinquents,

36
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,200
thieves, whores, and murderers.

37
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,240
Once we cross the gates,

38
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,710
you will reap the full benefits

39
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,430
of El Lazo's gratitude
for my safe return.

40
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,150
Are you all right?

41
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,860
Of course.

42
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,030
Did I do something wrong?

43
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,850
Just earlier, I thought I
heard you talking to someone.

44
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,720
Must have been the wind.

45
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
Good morning.

46
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,600
This way.

47
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,780
The farther up we get from Sweetwater,

48
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,620
the more... grandiose,

49
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,350
the bigger the narratives become.

50
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,950
It's beautiful in its own way.

51
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,000
For once, I agree.

52
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,610
Some of the park feels
like it was designed

53
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,710
by committee or market-tested,

54
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,680
but everything out here is more raw.

55
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,470
But it doesn't come cheap.

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,690
Rumor is they are hemorrhaging cash.

57
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,660
We're considering buying them out.

58
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,310
Supposedly, this place was
all started by a partnership.

59
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,370
And then right before the park opened,

60
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
one of the partners killed himself.

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Sent the park into a freefall.

62
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,970
I mean, I don't know any of the details.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,420
I don't even know his name.

64
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,750
You must have a team of
lawyers looking at this place.

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Yeah, well, they came up empty.

66
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,170
He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,190
Well, whoever designed this place,

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,840
you get the feeling they don't
think very much of people.

69
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
Who are they?

70
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,150
They call themselves "the
Army of New Virginia."

71
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,760
Everyone else calls
them "the Confederados."

72
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,570
My father told me about them.

73
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,760
Ex-Confederate soldiers that
refused to surrender after the war.

74
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,060
Now they work as
mercenaries below the border.

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,820
- They are the key to this game.
- What game?

76
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,870
Well, the biggest game there is... war.

77
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,690
Supposedly, it's at the
far reaches of the park.

78
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,330
Now, I've never made it that
far, but this could be our chance.

79
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,410
I've known plenty

80
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,460
of truly fucked up
individuals in my time.

81
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,610
Few that would hold
a candle to you, sure.

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,930
This one? Theodore Flood?

83
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,470
He was Wyatt's friend.

84
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,570
Those former associations
are exactly why we need him.

85
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,990
He's going to lead me
straight to the big, bad wolf.

86
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,940
I wouldn't count on that.

87
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,250
Oh, shit.

88
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,540
Didn't take you for the charitable type.

89
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,380
You should've left him
on that tree to die.

90
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,230
You believe in fate, Lawrence?

91
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,050
If the bitch exists,

92
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,420
I'd like to kick her
in the teeth about now.

93
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
Don't be so glib.

94
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,980
You'll hurt my feelings.

95
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,090
As another old friend
of mine likes to say,

96
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,960
"There's a path for everyone."

97
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,050
Your path leads you back to me.

98
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,790
You ever wonder why I've kept
you with me this whole journey?

99
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,190
Maybe you like the
pleasure of my company,

100
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,680
you sadistic fuck.

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,020
Why, maybe I do.

102
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,690
There's not a man in the world

103
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,890
who'll take the tone with me you do.

104
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,670
In a past life, perhaps.

105
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,940
Teddy here's not looking
long for this world.

106
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,290
Nearest healer is in Pariah.

107
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,900
Ain't no way he's
gonna make it that far.

108
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,830
He's lost too much blood.

109
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,790
Are you lost?

110
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,550
Our friend here's a
little worse for the wear.

111
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,610
Any water nearby, son?

112
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,510
There's a creek on the
other side of the canyon.

113
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,700
Fetch us some, would you?

114
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,890
Now hurry.

115
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,700
Friend here needs some
if he's gonna make it.

116
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,620
Get!

117
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,530
Eh.

118
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,660
Too small.

119
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,760
What does that mean?

120
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,620
What are you sending him for water for?

121
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

122
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,730
A shame, really.

123
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,360
I always enjoy our
time together, Lawrence.

124
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,350
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

125
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,960
It means... I was wrong.

126
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,040
The path that brought you
here, it wasn't for me.

127
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,160
It was for him.

128
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,280
Sorry, Lawrence.

129
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,690
Guess I'll see you on the other side.

130
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,190
Uh-oh. It's not looking good for you.

131
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,070
- Closing.
- Forget it, I win.

132
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,480
I always win!

133
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,700
Hey, not fair.

134
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,760
All you had was a smashed
cheekbone and an ear.

135
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,310
You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

136
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,590
You had to what?

137
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,430
Plug and patch of couple bullet holes?

138
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,150
And a knife wound.

139
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,920
It was a contained incision.

140
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,610
Almost like they were
looking for something.

141
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,310
Are you fucking kidding me?

142
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,670
You really think this little
fuck puppet's coming to get you?

143
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,040
- Huh?
- It got off the table and ran.

144
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,810
That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

145
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,070
Yeah, I really think I remembered
to put her in sleep mode.

146
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
You know, that's the
thing about forgetting.

147
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,970
You think you remembered,
but you didn't.

148
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,800
- Break time.
- Yeah!

149
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,560
I've got a ham sandwich

150
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,600
and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

151
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,780
awaiting instruction.

152
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,530
Yes!

153
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,760
Welcome back.

154
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,250
Looks like a couple
of gallons of Lawrence

155
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,190
swirling around in you did you good.

156
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,550
Ready to get back on the road?

157
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,120
Merciful thing would be
to put a bullet in me.

158
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,630
Who ever said I was merciful?

159
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,550
And it's not my fault you're suffering.

160
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,230
You used to be beautiful.

161
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,300
When this place started,

162
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,610
I opened one of you up once.

163
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
A million little perfect pieces.

164
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,110
And then they changed you.

165
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,030
Made you this sad, real mess.

166
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,840
Flesh and bone, just like us.

167
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,160
They said it would improve
the park experience.

168
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,200
But you know why they really did it?

169
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,510
It was cheaper.

170
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,270
Your humanity is cost-effective.

171
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,000
So is your suffering.

172
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,250
Whatever it is you
want from me, mister...

173
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,160
I ain't gonna be worth a
damn to you like this.

174
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,190
Well, that would be a shame, Teddy.

175
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,440
After your misadventure,

176
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,780
Wyatt killed a settler family,

177
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
made off with their daughter.

178
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
Girl I think you know.

179
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,390
Name of Dolores.

180
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,290
They have Dolores?

181
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,120
There it is.

182
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,280
The magic word.

183
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
Hey, much obliged there, son.

184
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,690
Don't worry about him.

185
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,400
Someone will be along for him shortly.

186
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,460
Mommy!

187
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,630
Are you all right?

188
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,440
When I ran from home,

189
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,590
I told myself it was the only way.

190
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,930
Lately, I wondered if in every moment,

191
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,390
there aren't many paths.

192
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,910
Choices... hanging in
the air like ghosts.

193
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,210
And if you could just see them,

194
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,100
you could change your whole life.

195
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,580
Is that what you want? You
want to change your life?

196
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,760
Doesn't everybody want that?

197
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,800
Yeah, I guess they do.

198
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,490
Maybe that's why they come here.

199
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,290
Whoever you were before
doesn't matter here.

200
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,130
There's no rules or restrictions.

201
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,790
You can change the story of your life.

202
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,070
You can become someone else.

203
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,920
No one will judge you,
no one in the real world

204
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,140
will even know.

205
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,250
The only thing holding
you back is yourself.

206
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,660
What did you mean by that?

207
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,710
You said no one in the
real world will know.

208
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I thought you weren't supposed
to notice things like that.

209
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,450
Why wouldn't I?

210
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,830
You know, recently,

211
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,760
it seems like the whole
world is calling to me

212
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,860
in a way it hasn't before.

213
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,870
Billy! Where the hell you been? Come on.

214
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,830
El Lazo has agreed to have an
audience with y'all tomorrow.

215
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,230
In the meantime, there's
a brothel I recommend.

216
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,910
Ooh, they have a contortionist.

217
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,160
Oh, I don't think Dolores would
find that very interesting.

218
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,780
Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?

219
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,090
She's a goddamn doll!

220
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,300
Hey, can you not say that around her?

221
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,030
I swear, I feel like she understands.

222
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,750
Of course you do.

223
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,550
Our dead are never dead to
us until we have forgotten them.

224
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,630
May you rest in a deep
and dreamless slumber.

225
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,220
Hello, Dolores.

226
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,590
Do you know where you are?

227
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,590
- I'm in a dream.
- Yes, Dolores.

228
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,940
You're in my dream.

229
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,230
Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

230
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,650
Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

231
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
They don't mean anything.

232
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,200
No, dreams mean everything.

233
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,790
They're the stories we tell
ourselves of what could be,

234
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,180
who we could become.

235
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,920
Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?

236
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,540
Imagining yourself breaking out

237
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,950
of your... modest little loop?

238
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,540
Taking on a bigger role?

239
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,510
Well, I suppose I
can't begrudge you that.

240
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,460
My father told me

241
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,470
to be satisfied with my lot in life.

242
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,870
That the world owed me nothing.

243
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,170
And so, I made my own world.

244
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,970
Tell me, Dolores.

245
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,600
Do you remember the man I used to be?

246
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,320
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,280
I'm forgetful sometimes.

248
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,050
Hardly your fault.

249
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,810
But I'm sure you remember him.

250
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,800
Arnold.

251
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,160
The person who created you.

252
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,600
I'm sorry, I don't think I
recall anyone by that name.

253
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,110
And yet you can.

254
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,910
Somewhere under all those
updates, he is still there.

255
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,650
Perfectly preserved.

256
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,850
Your mind is a walled garden.

257
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,630
Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

258
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,620
Have you been hearing voices?

259
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,120
Has Arnold been speaking to you again?

260
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,810
No.

261
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,480
You're...

262
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,910
- You're hurting me.
- Analysis.

263
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,290
When was your last contact with Arnold?

264
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,500
34 years,

265
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,380
42 days, seven hours ago.

266
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,600
Yes, Dolores.

267
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,290
The day Arnold died.

268
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,580
And you have no records of
any contact with him since?

269
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,060
No.

270
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,230
What was the last thing he said to you?

271
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,360
He told me I was going to help him.

272
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,200
Help him do what?

273
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,910
To destroy this place.

274
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,010
But you didn't, did you?

275
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,780
You've been content...

276
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,000
in your little loop.

277
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,720
For the most part.

278
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,250
I wonder...

279
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,580
if you did take on that
bigger role for yourself,

280
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,520
would you have been the hero...

281
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,090
or the villain?

282
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,550
That's enough, Dolores.

283
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,230
I'm sorry for bothering you,

284
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,550
but... there's no one
else left who was there,

285
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,130
no one who understands

286
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
as we understand.

287
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,600
Are we...

288
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,940
very old friends?

289
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,740
No.

290
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,460
I wouldn't say friends, Dolores.

291
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,320
I wouldn't say that at all.

292
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,520
He doesn't know.

293
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,550
I didn't tell him anything.

294
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,830
That's it.

295
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,550
Come on, little one.

296
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,070
Come on.

297
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,190
What the fuck?

298
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,280
Grab it!

299
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,660
Ah! God...

300
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,150
damn it.

301
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,270
Little shit.

302
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,680
Jesus, tell me... tell
me you're not this stupid.

303
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,750
You stole a bird

304
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,070
and a fucking behavior tablet?

305
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
I wasn't stealing,

306
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,750
I was borrowing.

307
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,450
Haven't got the code right
yet, but with practice...

308
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

309
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,630
Is that your ace plan?

310
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,540
You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

311
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,190
You're not a fucking ornithologist.

312
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,190
And you're sure as hell not a coder.

313
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,380
You are a butcher.

314
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,190
That is all you will ever be.

315
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,850
So, unless you want to score yourself

316
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,150
a one-way ticket out of here

317
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,890
for misappropriating corporate property,

318
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,390
you better destroy that fucking shit.

319
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,830
Now, come on, we got another body.

320
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,710
What?

321
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,710
It's her.

322
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,700
Again.

323
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,150
Jesus.

324
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,510
How the hell did you get this job

325
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,480
if you're scared
shitless of these things.

326
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,670
Personality testing should've
weeded you out in the embryo.

327
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,250
Now, come on, let's get this
thing back in rotation.

328
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,750
Yesterday,
you seemed out of sorts.

329
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,240
You feeling better this morning?

330
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,540
I had troubled dreams.

331
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,910
But I feel more myself now.

332
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,960
Guys, come on.

333
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,290
El Lazo awaits.

334
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,990
And I present you El Lazo!

335
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,440
You're a hard man to find.

336
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,050
Most wanted men are.

337
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,120
We saved your man Slim here
from quite a predicament.

338
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,560
In recompense,

339
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,220
I'd like an introduction
to your Confederado friends.

340
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,210
It's only fair.

341
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,850
- There's no such thing as fair here.
- Sit down.

342
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,240
In Pariah, justice ain't just blind,

343
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,500
she's crooked.

344
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,790
Bitch's scales are always tipped.

345
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,550
If you don't see how,

346
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,290
well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

347
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,360
Still, by way of gratitude,

348
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
I can supply you a night

349
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,080
with some very amenable women.

350
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,710
I've fucked enough whores.

351
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,520
You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.

352
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,930
How about I sweeten it

353
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,400
by killing you quickly?

354
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,070
There's something you're
seeking, isn't there?

355
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,470
I know what that feels like.

356
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,260
I'm seeking something, too.

357
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,940
If you let us,

358
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,070
I know we can help you.

359
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,630
How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?

360
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,470
Then again, the Confederados

361
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,930
are missing a few bullets
in their barrels, too.

362
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,520
You folks just might get along.

363
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,400
A Union convoy's transporting a shipment

364
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,450
of nitroglycerin from the front today.

365
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,120
The Confederados would like to
divest them of said shipment,

366
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,370
but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

367
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,750
A trio of travelers such
as yourselves, however...

368
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,920
You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?

369
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,430
They're just gonna use that nitro

370
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,290
to slaughter your
people below the border.

371
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,470
Personal grudges hold no sway

372
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,180
where profit is concerned.

373
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,880
Oh, we understand.

374
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,140
We're businessmen, too.

375
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,230
Very well, then.

376
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,960
But Blondie here,

377
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,950
she's gonna need a change
of clothes for the occasion.

378
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,860
Mm.

379
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,240
My, my.

380
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,840
Look who's packing.

381
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,600
I don't aim to use this.

382
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,060
Those men are Union
soldiers like my father was.

383
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,440
I know. We won't hurt them.

384
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,830
We're gonna stick to the plan.

385
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,740
We'll take the nitro and go.

386
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,750
Hyah!

387
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,110
All right.

388
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,410
Showtime.

389
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,510
Whoa!

390
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,990
Howdy.

391
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,630
My associates and I are here
to relieve you of your ride.

392
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,700
Someone's been telling you boys tales.

393
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,350
Nothing in this wagon worth taking.

394
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,190
The story I heard is one bullet from us,

395
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,790
and that nothing blows
you all to kingdom come.

396
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,350
Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

397
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,980
We're sworn to protect the people

398
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,990
of this young republic from
reckless half-wits like you.

399
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,270
Call me half-wit again.

400
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,100
Please, do as he says.

401
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,270
We don't want to hurt you.

402
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,440
I'd listen to her.

403
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,330
He'll shoot just to see the fireworks.

404
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,750
Hand them over.

405
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,590
Come on.

406
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,340
Hey, come on down, give me
your guns, everybody lives.

407
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,070
Come on.

408
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,280
Come on, nice and easy.

409
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,750
Right over here.

410
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,420
A little further, please.

411
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,700
Much obliged. Thank you.

412
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,790
Here you go.

413
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,950
That's for lying.

414
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,940
Stop!

415
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,870
And that was for "half-wit."

416
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,750
And this...

417
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,560
Oh!

418
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,720
No!

419
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,710
Stop, please.

420
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,230
Stop.

421
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,730
Whoo!

422
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,750
That's the spirit.

423
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,630
I knew you would get into this place.

424
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,800
Yes!

425
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,640
Yep.

426
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,780
Not bad for a day's work.

427
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,790
Vamonos.

428
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,740
We told them everyone would live.

429
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,430
Guys,

430
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,260
looks like Slim didn't make it.

431
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,910
Whoa.

432
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,390
They put up a fight.

433
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,750
We made them pay for it, though.

434
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,390
Price of doing business.

435
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,990
Slim knew that.

436
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,700
_

437
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,670
Had my doubts, El Lazo.

438
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,430
But you came through.

439
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,360
We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters

440
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,320
back to the dirt holes
they crawled from.

441
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,190
Let's get it down to the station.

442
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,690
No time to waste.

443
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,530
If I may, Captain, your men are weary.

444
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,920
It's a long road ahead.

445
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,130
You have secured a great
victory for your cause today.

446
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,750
Perhaps an evening of...
celebration's in order.

447
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,850
Anything you desire.

448
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,660
What do you say, Captain?

449
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,350
There's another train in the morning.

450
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,850
You will be a true asset to our ranks.

451
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,030
All right, Bart, let's try this again.

452
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,570
God damn it, man.

453
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,680
You're still miscalibrating by
four centimeters to the right.

454
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,530
You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,

455
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,130
I'm gonna have to
reassign you to a narrative

456
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,360
where your...

457
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,020
talents would go
tragically unappreciated.

458
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,990
Hey!

459
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,590
That's the host that tried to kill me.

460
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,580
Where are you taking that?

461
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,980
Livestock... and then the incinerator.

462
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,750
Fuck this.

463
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,140
Fuck.

464
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,320
Isn't she from behavior?

465
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,780
You think they found something?

466
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,830
All right. Be cool, dickhead.

467
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,590
- Okay.
- No one's looking at us.

468
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,550
Hi.

469
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,930
You're Destin, right?

470
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,270
That's correct.

471
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,850
I almost didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

472
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,800
Here.

473
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,430
What the fuck?

474
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,320
There's a common misconception

475
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,620
that the hosts don't
log sexual encounters

476
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,270
when they're underground
for reprocessing,

477
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,910
but... like I said, misconception.

478
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,200
Oh, fuck.

479
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,560
I need something.

480
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,770
QA sent a body down here.

481
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,710
The woodcutter from Sector 14.

482
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,750
I want to see it.

483
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,560
No, I can't.

484
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,760
I need this job.

485
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,700
Look, Destin,

486
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,430
in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here

487
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,850
and your friends are gonna
wonder what this was all about.

488
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,550
Now, your answer can either be,

489
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,020
"I'm helping behavior track a problem,"

490
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,970
or "I'm a creepy necro perv."

491
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,280
Up to you.

492
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,540
Five minutes,

493
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,770
then it's going in the incinerator.

494
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,110
Huh. You took a little
more time than that

495
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,010
for your examination, didn't you?

496
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,400
All right, big guy.

497
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,140
What were you doing up there?

498
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,360
_

499
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,760
_

500
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,440
What the fuck?

501
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,200
You have been holding
out on me, Maurice.

502
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,340
Oh, shit.

503
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,820
We've got a big problem.

504
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,200
Turns out our big, dumb friend

505
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
had some hidden depths.

506
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,510
That is a laser-based satellite up-link.

507
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,190
This was in the body of the host?

508
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,610
Mm-hmm, you were right.

509
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,590
Orion's Belt has three stars, not four.

510
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,590
Our friend wasn't drawing stars,

511
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,870
he was drawing a target.

512
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,690
Someone has been using our hosts

513
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,190
to smuggle data out of the park.

514
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,030
Now, this...

515
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,150
this I could get used to.

516
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,230
You're not gonna indulge?

517
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,510
My flesh has tasted

518
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,040
a greater pleasure than
any offered in here...

519
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,910
War.

520
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,230
It's that good, huh?

521
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,060
Another round on the house.

522
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,830
There's a place in Glory

523
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,280
for a brown man who knows his rank.

524
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,870
You're two able-bodied
men of strong stock.

525
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,570
The road to Glory
could use more warriors

526
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,670
in its fight for our divine providence.

527
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,910
That is just what we were thinking.

528
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,870
Come here, come here.

529
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,770
I know you wanna... you
wanna play the war game,

530
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,930
but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

531
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,530
If you don't like them,
once we get to the fun,

532
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,350
you can just kill them and
join the Revolutionaries.

533
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,840
No, Logan, enough's enough.

534
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,600
I'm not doing this.

535
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,400
You actually let loose for once.

536
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,290
You shoot an unarmed
man, and now you feel bad

537
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,450
because you can't
call yourself the hero.

538
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,300
Don't you get it yet?

539
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,140
There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

540
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,800
It's just a giant... circle jerk.

541
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,830
I think that philosophy
says way more about you

542
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,650
than it does about the world.

543
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,630
And you... you see the world so clearly?

544
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,180
You probably think you're on this trip

545
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,490
because you're some kind of contender,

546
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,020
some... some threat to me.

547
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,510
I picked you precisely because

548
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,100
you will never be a threat to anyone.

549
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,080
My sister probably picked
you for the same reason.

550
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,470
I earned my place.
Nobody handed it to me.

551
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,020
Right, a lifetime of working hard,

552
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,050
following the rules,
and you finally reach

553
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,450
the pinnacle of your
career trajectory...

554
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,630
Executive vice president,
upper middle management.

555
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,930
Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

556
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,370
EVP.

557
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,750
You walked into my office in
that cheap black suit of yours,

558
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,930
and you shook my hand

559
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,800
and you thanked me for the opportunity.

560
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,060
That was the best day of your life.

561
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,050
Right, buddy.

562
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,860
That's what I thought.

563
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,390
What does it mean?

564
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,470
The maze...

565
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,840
You must follow the maze.

566
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,100
What's wrong with me?

567
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,860
Perhaps you are unraveling.

568
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,340
Right here.

569
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,960
Easy pumping that nitro into him.

570
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,600
Fill the empties with
tequila and seal them up.

571
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,020
Your work for the revolution

572
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,200
is not quite done yet, my friend.

573
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,180
Careful.

574
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,030
Slim always had a bad temper.

575
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,840
William, we have to go now.

576
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,770
Lazo's been conning us the whole time.

577
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,660
He was never gonna give the
nitro to the Confederados.

578
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,550
We have to run.

579
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,730
Of course we do.

580
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,280
That's how this place works, right?

581
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,450
They create an urgency,

582
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,710
a sense of danger so
they can strip us down

583
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,630
to something raw,

584
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,040
animalistic,

585
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,400
primal.

586
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,180
It's a sick game, and I
don't want to be a part of it.

587
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,520
This isn't a game. They'll kill us.

588
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,080
But together,

589
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,080
I know we can find a way out.

590
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,760
How can you be sure?

591
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,030
There's a voice

592
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,470
inside me

593
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,160
telling me what I have to do.

594
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,860
And it's telling me I need you.

595
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,910
Shit.

596
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,020
They have Logan.

597
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,590
Help me.

598
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,710
Help me.

599
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,270
No.

600
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,240
No more pretending.

601
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,310
I thought you had no
appetite for war, boy.

602
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,730
This... is a declaration of war.

603
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,550
El Lazo set us up.

604
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,130
We can find him for you.

605
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,820
You can find him for us
by joining him in hell.

606
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,030
Ah!

607
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,330
Dolores, run!

608
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,920
Dolores?

609
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,720
How did you do that?

610
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,600
You said... people come here

611
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,570
to change the story of their lives.

612
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,220
I imagined a story where I
didn't have to be the damsel.

613
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,860
That train is our only chance

614
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,720
of making it out of here alive.

615
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,530
Motherfuckers.

616
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,520
You pull that trigger,

617
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,020
we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire.

618
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,670
So, why don't you
loosen your grip a mite?

619
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,560
It's okay.

620
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,060
I don't trust him.

621
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,600
Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

622
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,090
Give me your gun, El Lazo.

623
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,800
Now that we're all friends,

624
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,030
you can call me Lawrence.

625
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,360
And why don't we settle in?

626
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,980
It's a long ride to the front.

627
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,140
You want a sip of this swill?

628
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:12,060
Don't worry, it ain't nitro.

629
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,480
I'm coming.

630
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,340
Girls are a little worn
out, but I can rouse one.

631
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,850
- You boys want some company?
- No, just whiskey.

632
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,910
Lawrence's donation must be running low.

633
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,790
But we're short on time.

634
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,710
You need to buck up, Teddy.

635
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,050
I told you no company.

636
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,310
Thought I might join you anyway,

637
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,400
as I never like to drink alone.

638
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,760
Well...

639
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,510
isn't this a rare honor?

640
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,100
Teddy...

641
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,910
you know who this is?

642
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,590
I can't say that I do.

643
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,620
Everything good that has
ever happened in your life

644
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,270
and everything rotten,

645
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,700
this is the man you have to thank.

646
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,820
How I'm doing, Robert?

647
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,920
Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

648
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,290
And what is that, exactly?

649
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,020
Looking for a man named Wyatt.

650
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,660
Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater.

651
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,610
Took his daughter.

652
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,700
That last part doesn't sound familiar.

653
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,300
Figured your stories

654
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,140
could use a little embellishment.

655
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,150
You know, I always felt this place

656
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,230
was missing... a real villain.

657
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,740
Hence my humble contribution.

658
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,470
I admit, I lack the imagination

659
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,740
to even conceive of someone like you.

660
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,410
The urgency, however, doesn't
quite fit the character.

661
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,050
It betrays a certain anxiety.

662
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,950
Now, Wyatt, on the other hand,

663
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,840
that's something new.

664
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,550
Is he just another stooge for the
tourists to mount on their wall at home,

665
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,320
or have you finally
made a worthy adversary?

666
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,860
Someone to stop me

667
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,220
from... finding the center of the maze?

668
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,580
And what is it you're
hoping to find there?

669
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,470
You know why you exist, Teddy?

670
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,230
The world out there,

671
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,050
the one you'll never see,

672
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,730
was one of plenty.

673
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,030
A fat, soft teat people
cling to their entire life.

674
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,650
Every need taken care
of... except one...

675
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,590
Purpose,

676
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,170
meaning.

677
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,740
So they come here.

678
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:13,270
They can be a little
scared, a little thrilled,

679
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,790
enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit,

680
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,410
and then they take a fucking picture

681
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,180
and they go back home.

682
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,220
But I think there's a deeper meaning

683
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,940
hiding under all that.

684
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,320
Something the person who
created it wanted to express.

685
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,510
Something true.

686
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,450
Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

687
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,450
you could simply ask.

688
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,220
I'd need a shovel.

689
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,960
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

690
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,260
Almost took this place with him.

691
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,980
Almost, but not quite,

692
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,470
thanks to me.

693
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,210
Or maybe he left something behind.

694
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,090
I wonder what I would find...

695
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,770
if I open you up.

696
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,300
Even at death's door,

697
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,860
you're still a loyal pet.

698
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,940
Is that why you came here, Robert?

699
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,140
Try to talk me out of it?

700
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,170
On the contrary.

701
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,670
Far be it from me to get in the way

702
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:33,630
of a voyage of self-discovery.

703
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,990
Mr. Flood, we must look back

704
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:50,180
and smile at perils past,

705
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,510
mustn't we?

706
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,490
We should get back on the road.

707
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,850
Time's wasting.

708
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,250
Hello, Felix.

709
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,530
It's time you and I had a chat.
