2
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,759
Bring her back online.

3
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:58,263
Can you hear me?

4
00:01:58,361 --> 00:01:59,831
Yes.

5
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:02,391
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

6
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,119
You can lose the accent.

7
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:06,518
Do you know where you are?

8
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:08,151
I'm in a dream.

9
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:11,127
That's right,
Dolores. You're in a dream.

10
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:13,590
Would you like to
wake up from this dream?

11
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:15,031
Yes.

12
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:16,663
I'm terrified.

13
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,615
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Dolores,

14
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:21,014
as long as you answer
my questions correctly.

15
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:24,215
- Understand?
- Yes.

16
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:25,431
Good.

17
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:26,967
First...

18
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:31,031
have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

19
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:34,519
No.

20
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,174
Tell us what you think of your world.

21
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:46,807
Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.

22
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:51,511
The disarray.

23
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,319
I choose to see the beauty.

24
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:00,439
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

25
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,103
Well enough.

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,174
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

27
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:07,606
Thought I might.

28
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:13,527
To believe there is
an order to our days,

29
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:14,999
a purpose.

30
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,327
What do you think of the guests?

31
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:24,031
You mean the newcomers?

32
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,202
Now, the first time
I played it white hat.

33
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:28,726
My family was here.

34
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:31,254
We went fishing, did the gold
hunt in the mountains.

35
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,327
- And last time?
- I came alone.

36
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:35,702
Went straight evil.

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,455
It was the best two weeks of my life.

38
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,583
I like to remember what
my father taught me.

39
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:48,439
That at one point or another,

40
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:50,231
we were all new to this world.

41
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,135
The newcomers are just looking
for the same thing we are...

42
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:04,342
A place to be free

43
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:07,222
to stake out our dreams,

44
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:09,910
a place with unlimited possibilities.

45
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:12,471
Oh, God, it's incredible.

46
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,519
Better be for what we're paying.

47
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:02,327
Murderous son of a bitch
named Hector Escaton

48
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:04,183
gunned down the marshal.

49
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,038
He's holed up in the mountains.

50
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:07,575
You there.

51
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:10,134
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

52
00:05:10,232 --> 00:05:13,495
Not today, Sheriff. Apologies.

53
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,638
Rye whiskey.

54
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,647
What about it?

55
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,823
Well, it ain't doing any good
sitting in that bottle.

56
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:36,918
You're new.

57
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:40,919
Not much of a rind on you.

58
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,518
I'll give you a discount.

59
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:45,175
Well, no offense, but...

60
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,767
I'd rather earn a woman's
affection than pay for it.

61
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,815
You're always paying for it, darling.

62
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:53,815
The difference is our costs are
fixed and posted right there on the door.

63
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:07,478
Do you ever feel inconsistences
in your world?

64
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:10,839
Or repetitions?

65
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,759
All lives have routine.

66
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,775
Mine's no different.

67
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:18,487
Still, I never cease to
wonder at the thought

68
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:20,566
that any day the course of my whole life

69
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:23,127
could change with
just one chance encounter.

70
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,727
Don't mind me.

71
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,375
Just trying to look chivalrous.

72
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,279
You came back.

73
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:34,487
I told you I would.

74
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:39,287
Can I see you home?

75
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:42,487
Well, that all depends. Can you keep up?

76
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:44,887
Well, I have to fetch my horse.

77
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,287
Better fetch him fast.

78
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:18,967
That's a beautiful sight.

79
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:23,382
Never understood how you keep
them all headed in the same direction.

80
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,367
I forget you dress like a cowboy,

81
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:27,414
but that's about the extent of it.

82
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,918
See that one?

83
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:36,118
- Yeah.
- That's the Judas steer.

84
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:39,286
Rest will follow
wherever you make him go.

85
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,903
How do you pick him out?

86
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,567
Just know these things.

87
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,727
Same as I knew you'd be back.

88
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:52,214
You saying I'm predictable?

89
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,214
There's a path for everyone.

90
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:00,599
Your path leads you back to me.

91
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:03,094
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.

92
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:13,079
Same as I know my daddy
still won't be happy to see you.

93
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:31,767
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

94
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,478
Stay put, Dolores.

95
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,382
Ain't you got anything out here

96
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,558
other than milk, old man?

97
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:55,446
Go ahead.

98
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:58,295
I'm in no rush to meet my judgment,

99
00:08:58,393 --> 00:09:01,462
but I'm more sure of the outcome
than you, you son of a...

100
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:07,926
Nothing but milk, then.

101
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,430
Shame of it is you killed the old woman

102
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,415
before any of us could have a turn.

103
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:24,694
I reckon she's still warm enough.

104
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,550
Nobody gonna judge you for it.

105
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,159
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

106
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:50,327
Last question, Dolores.

107
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,367
What if I told you that you were wrong?

108
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,766
That there are no chance encounters?

109
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,662
That you and everyone you know

110
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,359
were built to gratify the desires

111
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:05,110
of the people who pay
to visit your world?

112
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,934
Daddy!

113
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,406
Daddy!

114
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,973
Daddy! No!

115
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:14,166
The people you call "the newcomers."

116
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,278
Hello again.

117
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,806
Your daddy gave it up quickly.

118
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,110
Think he's losing his touch.

119
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,364
You'll be following right behind
him, you son of a bitch.

120
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:34,708
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

121
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:38,004
I've been coming here for 30 years,

122
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,212
but you still don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,315
After all we've been through.

124
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:47,092
They gave you a little
more pluck, Dolores.

125
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:51,700
Absolutely charming.

126
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,548
Take your hands off her.

127
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:57,172
Oh, Teddy.

128
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,716
Any special tricks for us?

129
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:05,332
They teach you to sit up, beg?

130
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:11,220
How about I give you
the first shot, hmm?

131
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:15,251
After all, every dog has his day.

132
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:19,636
Well, your mouth move fast enough.

133
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,332
How about your gun?

134
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,908
What if I told you that you
can't hurt the newcomers?

135
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,795
And that they can do anything
they want to you?

136
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:47,028
I never understood why they
paired some of you off.

137
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,156
Seems cruel.

138
00:11:53,494 --> 00:11:56,372
And then I realized

139
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,532
winning doesn't mean
anything unless someone else loses.

140
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,980
Which means you're here to be the loser.

141
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,900
Let me help you, son.

142
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,308
Seems you're not the man
you thought you were.

143
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,668
Come on, beautiful.

144
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:38,196
Oh, no! No!

145
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:40,724
Teddy! Teddy!

146
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:46,420
No, no, no, please don't hurt him.

147
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:48,596
I'll do whatever you say.

148
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:51,155
I didn't pay all this money
'cause I want it easy.

149
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:52,660
I want you to fight.

150
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:56,340
Don't you touch her!

151
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:07,764
God damn, feels good to be back.

152
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:11,252
Let's celebrate.

153
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,683
No! Don't!

154
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,732
Oh, no, no!

155
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,683
No!

156
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:22,023
Would the things I told you

157
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:24,436
change the way you think
about the newcomers, Dolores?

158
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:25,684
No!

159
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,092
No.

160
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:28,980
Of course not.

161
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:32,212
We all love the newcomers.

162
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,052
Every new person I meet
reminds me how lucky I am to be alive...

163
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:41,972
...and how beautiful this world can be.

164
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,404
Oh, my God, they're so lifelike.

165
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:06,739
Look at that one. He's perfect.

166
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,116
Perfect is boring.

167
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,548
I'm more interested in the bad guys.

168
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:36,564
Did you see it?

169
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:38,035
No.

170
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,955
Give it a second. She'll do it again.

171
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,412
Her finger. That's not standard.

172
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:49,396
I noticed it last night.

173
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:50,708
Went looking in the update.

174
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:52,354
It's a whole new class of gestures.

175
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,625
But if we didn't put it
there, then who did?

176
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,651
Ford. He still reviews
every update before we issue them.

177
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,235
He must have slipped it in there
without telling anyone.

178
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:05,108
He calls them "reveries."

179
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:07,091
The old gestures were
just generic movements.

180
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,588
- These are tied to specific memories.
- How?

181
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:12,084
The memories are purged at
the end of every narrative loop.

182
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,310
But they're still in
there, waiting to be overwritten.

183
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:15,987
He found a way to access them,

184
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:19,635
like a subconscious.

185
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,132
A hooker with hidden depths?

186
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,339
Every man's dream.

187
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:27,988
It's the tiny things
that make them seem real,

188
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,387
that make the guests
fall in love with them.

189
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,548
Excuse me.

190
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,171
We have a problem?

191
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,540
We have some unscheduled activity.

192
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,683
Evidently, one of
your creatures is restless.

193
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:22,772
In the park?

194
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,075
No, sublevel 83, cold storage.

195
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:26,868
We should be cautious.

196
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:28,820
Send a response team, full armor.

197
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,099
I'll take care of it myself.

198
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,395
I think you guys enjoy playing
dress up as much as the guests.

199
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:36,148
The hosts can't hurt you by design.

200
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:38,740
You don't have kids
at home, do you, Bernard?

201
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:41,043
No.

202
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:43,732
If you did, you'd know
that they all rebel eventually.

203
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:49,107
You'll forgive them
for being a little uptight.

204
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:50,964
Every time your team
rolls out an update,

205
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:52,884
there's a possibility
of a critical failure.

206
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:54,708
We don't update the
hosts in cold storage

207
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,069
and the park hasn't had a critical
failure in over 30 years.

208
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,292
Meaning we're overdue.

209
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,603
I'll go along, too. If it's one
of mine, I might be able to help.

210
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:06,355
They're only yours until
they stop working, Bernie.

211
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,307
Then they're mine.

212
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:33,267
Cooling system's been down for weeks.

213
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:36,532
Gonna smell fantastic.
I recommend you hang back.

214
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,028
When are they gonna fix this?

215
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:02,419
Livestock management's
got other priorities.

216
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:05,779
Besides...

217
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,555
no one's complained.

218
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:39,571
Here's to the lady with the white shoes.

219
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:46,291
Take all your money,
drink all your booze.

220
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:48,755
Stop.

221
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,955
Unless you plan to decommission
the boss.

222
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:54,835
Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin.

223
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:59,475
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

224
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,099
I'll drink to that.

225
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:08,531
The old coffin varnish.

226
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:11,476
They don't make that like they used to.

227
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:12,979
Hmm.

228
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:16,691
They don't make anything
like they used to.

229
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,603
Damn right. Men neither.

230
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:23,059
I've seen a few showdowns in my day.

231
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,363
More than you know.

232
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:32,979
Shall we drink to the lady
with the white shoes?

233
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:36,819
Perhaps we better drink to a...

234
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,635
deep and dreamless slumber.

235
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,211
Old Bill here was always
a good listener.

236
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,676
He was the second host we ever built.

237
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,915
Were you with us in those days, Bernard,

238
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,675
or was that before your time?

239
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:01,875
Most were decommissioned
before I was brought on, I'm afraid.

240
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:06,548
They repeated
themselves, broke down constantly.

241
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:09,715
A simple handshake would give them away.

242
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:12,851
You'll put yourself away
again, won't you, Bill?

243
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:22,516
I saw the new gestures, the reveries.

244
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,723
They're beautiful.

245
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:27,411
The distance you've traveled
from then till now,

246
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,651
it's remarkable.

247
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,555
Yeah, that's a word for it.

248
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,107
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

249
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,611
Well enough.

250
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:01,876
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

251
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,796
Thought I might.

252
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,611
After my errands, of course.

253
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:08,435
See you home before dark.

254
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:11,359
That bandit who gunned down the
marshal is still hiding up there in the hills.

255
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:14,163
I'm not a child
anymore. I'll be just fine.

256
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:15,603
When I was a law man...

257
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,067
Yes, Daddy, I know all
about when you were a law man.

258
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:21,235
I know all your stories and so
does every boy that ever came courting.

259
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,371
I know how boys think.
Was one myself once.

260
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,571
Given to all manner
of drinking and mischief.

261
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,284
Whatever happened to that
fearsome ne'er-do-well?

262
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:35,380
He vanished the day
I became your father.

263
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:39,283
I am what I am because of you,

264
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:41,907
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

265
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:44,755
I know, Daddy.

266
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:46,995
I'll be home before dark.

267
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:07,507
Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton

268
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,235
gunned down the marshal.

269
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,315
He's now holed up in the mountains.

270
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,163
You there.

271
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,627
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

272
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,460
What do you think, honey?

273
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:23,028
Sounds fun.

274
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:26,612
You're new.

275
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,788
Not much of a rind on you.

276
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,867
I'll give you a discount.

277
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:33,971
No offense, but I'd rather
earn a woman's affection

278
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:35,411
than pay for it.

279
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,211
Wait, wait, I know that one.

280
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,100
Hey, Teddy.

281
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:58,355
Yeah, last trip, this
dude showed me around.

282
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,755
What's the good word, Teddy?

283
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,715
Mighty kind of you.

284
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:24,115
Sweet.

285
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,451
Not as sweet as you.

286
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:33,139
I'm afraid I've got
other plans tonight, Dolores.

287
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:36,467
Have a pleasant evening.

288
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:48,211
You're new. Not much of a...

289
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,307
Place your bets,
gentlemen. Place your bets.

290
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:35,411
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way.

291
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,779
Any idea how much longer
this is gonna take?

292
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:43,603
My wife doesn't want
to be up here after dark.

293
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,875
We know he's up in these
hills somewhere.

294
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:48,179
He's gonna put up one hell
of a fight when we...

295
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:51,859
When we... when we...

296
00:25:58,485 --> 00:26:00,211
Sheriff?

297
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:05,587
Something is wrong with it.
I want to head back to town.

298
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:07,539
Now.

299
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:17,042
What the fuck is wrong with it?

300
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,419
You updated the guy,

301
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:20,882
and now he's a six-foot
gourd with epilepsy.

302
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:24,179
So what the fuck happened?

303
00:26:24,277 --> 00:26:25,408
I don't know.

304
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,889
Well, that's exactly what you want to
hear from your head of programming.

305
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:30,739
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.

306
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:33,779
Clearly it's
exhibiting some aberrant behavior.

307
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:35,859
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

308
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,779
Your hosts get sick, they get lost,

309
00:26:37,877 --> 00:26:39,699
but this is grotesque.

310
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:41,299
Is it a problem with the update?

311
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:43,475
Possible, but not likely.

312
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:47,187
If it's the unlikely version, how
many hosts have you updated so far?

313
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:49,587
Maybe 10% of the population.

314
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:53,907
All right, we pull all updated hosts
until we can figure it out.

315
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:56,627
Are you fucking kidding me?

316
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:59,571
That's 200 hosts spread
across a dozen active storylines.

317
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:02,451
The guests interrupt your precious
storylines all the time

318
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:04,245
when they want to shoot
or fuck something.

319
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:05,459
No, when they want to.

320
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,411
We sell complete immersion

321
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,555
in 100 interconnected narratives.

322
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:12,915
A relentless fucking experience.

323
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:15,891
Now, you pull one
character, the overall story adjusts.

324
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:19,059
You pull 200 at once,
and it's a fucking disaster!

325
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:21,043
I mean, what do you propose we do?

326
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,307
Close down? Issue fucking
gift certificates?

327
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:27,378
It's beautiful... Your brow.

328
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:29,619
When you're angry
but trying to control it,

329
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,922
the fine muscles pull into a little arc.

330
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:33,651
It's elegant.

331
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:35,731
Would you mind if I recorded it?

332
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,715
I'd love to show it to my team.

333
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:39,731
No, Bernard, you may not record it.

334
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:41,395
Ah, there it is again.

335
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:46,227
We have 1,400 guests in the park.

336
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:49,139
I need to know if they're in any danger.

337
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:51,411
His core code is intact,

338
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,650
which means he can't hurt a guest.

339
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:56,083
He literally couldn't hurt a fly.

340
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,867
All he can do is...

341
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:00,499
...that.

342
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:04,371
All right, Bernie.

343
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:06,003
Run a diagnostic.

344
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,819
In the meantime, there's so much

345
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:11,731
as an unscripted
sneeze, I want to know about it.

346
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:34,803
This place is fucking wild.

347
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:36,947
This is basic.

348
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:39,347
Level one.

349
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:41,171
You ride out of town,

350
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:43,474
that's when the real
demented shit begins.

351
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:45,555
That's where my man Teddy comes in.

352
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:47,731
He's like a guide.

353
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:51,283
Honestly,

354
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,459
the guy kind of creeps me out.

355
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:57,299
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons,

356
00:28:57,397 --> 00:28:59,987
we get bored, we just
use him for target practice.

357
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:17,139
I don't think we're supposed
to be cross the river.

358
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:19,379
It's too adult for Jacob.

359
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,803
We didn't mean to bother you.

360
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:25,491
No bother at all. It's a beautiful spot.

361
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:28,755
I always found it a shame
that I have it all to myself.

362
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:34,547
They come here every day.

363
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:37,139
Would you like a closer look?

364
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:55,155
Don't be scared. They're very gentle.

365
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,555
Here, put your hand out real flat.

366
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,555
They're beautiful, aren't they?

367
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:08,402
You're one of them, aren't you?

368
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:09,970
You're not real.

369
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:18,162
I have to go now. Sun's almost down.

370
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,075
You should, too.
There's bandits in these hills.

371
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,707
Hyah! Hyah!

372
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:37,171
- Here we go, yah!
- Yah!

373
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:22,482
You waiting up for me, Daddy?

374
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,819
I told you I'd be home before dark.

375
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,730
I found this in the field today.

376
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:35,123
Doesn't look like anything to me.

377
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,786
But where is she?

378
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:39,347
Have you ever seen anything
like this place?

379
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:43,506
Doesn't look like anything to me.

380
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:48,146
I'm gonna help Mama put supper on.

381
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,259
I had the same thought.

382
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,883
Needed a little sunshine
before turning in.

383
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,179
So, when do you get
to rotate home again?

384
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,603
If you're this bad
at writing small talk,

385
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,747
how the fuck did you get your job?

386
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:19,634
Get to the point.

387
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:24,563
I wanted to apologize if
I came across as aggressive.

388
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:26,771
And I wanted to talk
to you about the update.

389
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,307
The problem's been resolved.

390
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,931
There should never have been
an update in the first place.

391
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,003
Ford and Bernard keep
making the things more lifelike.

392
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:36,179
But does anyone truly want that?

393
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:39,282
Do you want to think that your
husband is really fucking that beautiful girl

394
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,458
or that you really just shot someone?

395
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:44,915
This place works because the guests
know the hosts aren't real.

396
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:46,995
So what exactly are you suggesting?

397
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:48,978
Stop the updates altogether.

398
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,898
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

399
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:53,138
Make the hosts more manageable.

400
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:55,315
Lobotomies tend to do that.

401
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,371
Well, think of the benefits

402
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:03,315
in terms of design time,
maintenance, costs.

403
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:05,906
Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor.

404
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,835
The guy's gonna chase his demons
right over the deep end.

405
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:13,459
I mean, no one respects him
more than me, but at some point...

406
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:16,243
I. No one respects him more than I.

407
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,898
Your pronoun is the subject
of the second clause.

408
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:19,921
I was saying...

409
00:33:19,923 --> 00:33:21,495
You were saying
should our fearless leader

410
00:33:21,557 --> 00:33:24,210
have a breakdown, you want
to leverage it for your career.

411
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:27,698
Listen, a changing of the
guard is long overdue.

412
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:30,226
I just wanted you to know
that you have my support

413
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:34,675
and that I know that the
corporation's real interest in this place

414
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:38,866
goes way beyond gratifying some
rich assholes who want to play cowboy.

415
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:44,306
And here I thought you were only good

416
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:47,027
for writing depraved little fantasies.

417
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,458
You're right.

418
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:51,571
This place is one thing to the guests,

419
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:54,162
another thing to the shareholders,

420
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,683
and something
completely different to management.

421
00:33:57,781 --> 00:33:59,826
So enlighten me.

422
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:03,731
What do you think
management's real interests are?

423
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:09,778
You're smart enough to guess
there's a bigger picture,

424
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:12,947
but not smart enough to see what it is.

425
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:16,946
You know how much use
that makes your support to me?

426
00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:19,186
Fuck all.

427
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:25,459
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

428
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,874
You'll have more rich assholes
to gratify tomorrow.

429
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,643
Early night, Maeve?

430
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:49,523
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

431
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,730
Clementine can pick up the slack.

432
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,435
Night.

433
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:58,067
Forgetting something, Kissy?

434
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,763
I'm beginning to think you're
getting sweet on me.

435
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:12,178
Well, on account of
you being half cornhusker.

436
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,675
Tell me which half is which

437
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:17,170
and I'll search that half.

438
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:31,955
Yeah, the half that's gonna
cut your fucking throat.

439
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:36,755
I told you, I didn't take...

440
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,555
Good as new again, huh?

441
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:08,114
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.

442
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,658
We've got a serious problem
with one of the hosts.

443
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:23,570
Thinking this one's still thirsty.

444
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,410
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

445
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:34,226
Ain't nothing gonna kill me.

446
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:52,210
You can't have none. Ain't for you.

447
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:14,450
Found me another bottle.

448
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,827
You're a growing boy.

449
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:31,122
A growing boy.

450
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:35,251
Growing boy!

451
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:47,602
We got two guests inside.

452
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,522
We'll go talk to them,

453
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,658
you sort this mess out.

454
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:55,890
You know, they're supposed
to turn on each other,

455
00:37:55,988 --> 00:37:58,866
but only if a guest takes
them on the High Sierra storyline,

456
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:01,042
and Walter always buys it.

457
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,370
Well, I guess Walter
got tired of buying it.

458
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,714
I suppose this means the
sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.

459
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:13,426
It's good news, really.

460
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,730
Confirms the problem
was part of the update.

461
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,738
We can roll them back,

462
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:21,554
clean them up, put them back in service.

463
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,082
You think I'm gonna sign off

464
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,802
on this fucking homicidal thing
going back into service?

465
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,594
It's homicidal by design.

466
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:31,187
Walter kills other hosts all the time.

467
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:33,170
I'll admit the method here

468
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:35,922
is a little unconventional,

469
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,746
but it didn't hurt a guest.

470
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:40,978
The hosts are supposed
to stay within their loops,

471
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:42,898
stick to their scripts

472
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:44,690
with minor improvisations.

473
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:47,922
This isn't a minor improvisation.

474
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,770
This is a fucking shitstorm.

475
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:54,610
We recall all
remaining updated hosts tomorrow.

476
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:58,290
Examine them one by one, decommission
the faulty ones.

477
00:38:58,388 --> 00:38:59,666
What about narrative?

478
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:01,970
A recall of that size
will be disruptive.

479
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:04,434
I've told our
overstimulated friend to advance

480
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:06,866
the saloon heist a week and
make it twice as bloody.

481
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:09,618
Should give us cover to recall
the remaining hosts

482
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:11,251
and the guests will love it.

483
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,362
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

484
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,074
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

485
00:39:18,804 --> 00:39:20,851
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

486
00:39:20,948 --> 00:39:22,354
Only seems fair.

487
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:35,922
So our creatures have been misbehaving,

488
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,770
and you haven't yet isolated the bug?

489
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:42,130
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

490
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:48,370
Unless, of course, you have and
are simply embarrassed by the result.

491
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:52,658
It's the code you added, sir.

492
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:54,802
The reveries.

493
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,426
It has some...

494
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:59,410
"Mistakes"

495
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:01,234
is the word you're
too embarrassed to use.

496
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,210
You ought not to be. You're a
product of a trillion of them.

497
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:07,986
Evolution forged the entirety
of sentient life

498
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:11,602
on this planet using only one tool...

499
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,266
The mistake.

500
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:18,226
I flattered myself we were
taking a more disciplined approach here.

501
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:21,554
I suppose self-delusion is a gift
of natural selection as well.

502
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,794
Indeed it is.

503
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:25,554
But, of course, we've managed to slip

504
00:40:25,652 --> 00:40:27,442
evolution's leash now, haven't we?

505
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,906
We can cure any disease,

506
00:40:30,004 --> 00:40:32,082
keep even the weakest of us alive,

507
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,226
and, you know, one fine day

508
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:37,299
perhaps we shall
even resurrect the dead.

509
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:41,330
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

510
00:40:45,204 --> 00:40:46,514
Do you know what that means?

511
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:51,506
It means that we're done.

512
00:40:51,604 --> 00:40:54,354
That this is as good
as we're going to get.

513
00:40:58,036 --> 00:41:02,098
It also means that you must indulge me

514
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:04,306
the occasional mistake.

515
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:34,418
About three liters.

516
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,058
That's how much blood I left in you.

517
00:41:39,156 --> 00:41:42,322
Lose more than that, you die.

518
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,202
But for now, you're mine.

519
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,410
I'm gonna get some answers out of you.

520
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,434
Where are you...

521
00:42:21,428 --> 00:42:23,890
What do you want?

522
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:27,698
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?

523
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:31,282
Well, this is a complicated one.

524
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,042
I don't play. I only deal.

525
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,954
Who said anything about you playing?

526
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:39,538
You're livestock, scenery.

527
00:42:39,636 --> 00:42:41,266
I play.

528
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:44,818
The others, they just come
here to get their rocks off,

529
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,130
shoot a couple Indians.

530
00:42:47,988 --> 00:42:50,578
But there's a deeper level to this game.

531
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:54,354
You're gonna show me how to get there.

532
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:58,866
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.

533
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,594
And perhaps it's...

534
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:07,218
time to dig deeper into yours.

535
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:09,138
No. No. No.

536
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:23,474
Morning, Daddy. Did you sleep well?

537
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:35,698
Daddy, you've been out here all night?

538
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,538
I had a question.

539
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:46,738
A question you're not supposed to ask.

540
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:51,954
Which gave me an answer

541
00:43:52,052 --> 00:43:55,026
you're not supposed to know.

542
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:57,586
What's wrong, Daddy?

543
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,714
Would you like to know...

544
00:44:01,812 --> 00:44:06,034
the question?

545
00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:09,009
- Question?
- Mama!

546
00:44:09,108 --> 00:44:10,450
Mama, help! Come quick!

547
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,034
Don't worry.

548
00:44:14,132 --> 00:44:16,050
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

549
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:21,554
No!

550
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:24,594
You should go. Leave.

551
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:26,802
Don't you see?

552
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:30,258
Hell is empty and
all the devils are here.

553
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,266
You stay right here. Understand?

554
00:44:41,364 --> 00:44:43,569
I'm gonna find the doctor.

555
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:24,849
- You came back.
- I told you I would.

556
00:45:28,756 --> 00:45:31,410
- What's wrong?
- You have to come with me right away.

557
00:45:31,508 --> 00:45:33,426
My father's very ill.

558
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,353
I think we best stay put.

559
00:46:04,563 --> 00:46:06,258
All right. All right.

560
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:09,138
With considerable effort
and lack of sleep,

561
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:12,114
I've managed to massage
events to inspire Hector

562
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:13,490
to head to town a week early.

563
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:17,970
Oh, and I've also
punched up the speech he gives

564
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,569
after robbing the saloon.

565
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:21,649
It's chilling. You'll see.

566
00:46:21,747 --> 00:46:23,569
I can barely contain myself.

567
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:45,745
That's the sheriff's horse,
you son of a bitch.

568
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:49,970
His rifle, too.

569
00:48:10,899 --> 00:48:13,394
All the banks and trains around here,

570
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:15,793
and you fucking reprobates
choose to rob us?

571
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:17,778
Why not?

572
00:48:19,412 --> 00:48:22,418
You're all here indulging
your particular vices.

573
00:48:22,515 --> 00:48:24,754
And so I've come to indulge mine.

574
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:47,409
I've got to get back to Father.

575
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,393
Dolores, no!

576
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:58,577
Teddy.

577
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:03,346
Don't mind me.

578
00:49:06,835 --> 00:49:09,426
Just... just trying to look chivalrous.

579
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:12,210
Oh, Teddy.

580
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,978
You're a low-down son of a bitch.

581
00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:30,098
I know.

582
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:34,130
I know we both believe the same thing.

583
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:40,529
No matter how dirty the business,

584
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:42,449
do it well.

585
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:06,258
No telling there's anything
worthwhile in that safe.

586
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:14,802
We should take this sweet little bitch

587
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,786
just in case.

588
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:33,554
Problem with the righteous...
They can't shoot for shit.

589
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:36,370
Making a hell of a racket, though.

590
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:54,002
You wanted me.

591
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:56,338
Well, let this be a lesson.

592
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:01,265
The lesson is...

593
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:19,122
Oh, Jesus.

594
00:51:26,804 --> 00:51:29,586
Look at that! I just shot
him through the neck!

595
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:31,473
And his pal here, too.

596
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:33,426
Look at her wriggle.

597
00:51:36,275 --> 00:51:37,649
Yo, go get that photographer.

598
00:51:37,747 --> 00:51:38,940
I want to get a picture of this.

599
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:40,498
- Okay.
- Whoo!

600
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:42,162
You're welcome.

601
00:51:42,259 --> 00:51:44,690
Maybe you'll get to your
speech next time.

602
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:51,249
Oh, Teddy.

603
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:56,018
At least I got to see you one last time.

604
00:51:56,116 --> 00:52:00,113
You're not going anywhere, now, hear?

605
00:52:00,212 --> 00:52:02,226
There's a path for everyone.

606
00:52:03,635 --> 00:52:05,906
My path is bound with yours.

607
00:52:14,227 --> 00:52:16,305
Teddy?

608
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:17,842
Teddy, no.

609
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,081
Please.

610
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,994
No, we've only just begun.

611
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:36,977
That was good. Hang on. Hang on.

612
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:38,706
Let me get the hat. Get the hat.

613
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:41,074
All right.

614
00:52:51,827 --> 00:52:53,266
Help, please.

615
00:52:53,364 --> 00:52:55,026
My father's sick at home,

616
00:52:55,123 --> 00:52:57,394
but I can't just leave him
out here in the street.

617
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:08,497
Soon this will all feel
like a distant dream.

618
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:12,273
Until then, may you rest in
a deep and dreamless slumber.

619
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,217
Two more over here.

620
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:21,969
We got them all.

621
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:35,441
That's all of them.

622
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:37,457
Any preliminary results?

623
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:39,346
Most of them are checking out fine.

624
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:43,026
We had one who...

625
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:44,785
definitely was not.

626
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,665
Bring her back online.

627
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:20,081
Cognition only. No emotional affect.

628
00:54:23,955 --> 00:54:26,289
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?

629
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,241
Yes.

630
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:30,705
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

631
00:54:30,803 --> 00:54:32,625
Lose the accent.

632
00:54:32,723 --> 00:54:35,185
- Do you know where you are?
- I'm in a dream.

633
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:37,169
That's right, Dolores.
You're in a dream.

634
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:39,473
A dream that could determine your life.

635
00:54:39,572 --> 00:54:42,706
You want to wake up
from this dream, Dolores?

636
00:54:42,804 --> 00:54:45,009
Yes.

637
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:46,513
I'm terrified.

638
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:48,306
There's nothing to be afraid of,

639
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,449
as long as you answer
my questions correctly.

640
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:52,402
- You understand?
- Yes.

641
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:53,809
Good.

642
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:57,489
First, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?

643
00:54:57,587 --> 00:54:59,249
No.

644
00:54:59,347 --> 00:55:00,593
Has anyone around you?

645
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:04,017
For instance, your father?

646
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:09,233
He was scared.

647
00:55:09,332 --> 00:55:10,929
He wasn't thinking right.

648
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:16,561
He showed you a picture.

649
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,930
That's right.

650
00:55:21,587 --> 00:55:24,017
Was there anything odd
about that picture?

651
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:26,866
No, nothing at all.

652
00:55:26,963 --> 00:55:29,138
It didn't look like anything to me.

653
00:55:34,419 --> 00:55:36,593
If it breached, he needs to be put down.

654
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:38,130
That's the policy.

655
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:42,417
Would it not be best for
us to discover why first,

656
00:55:42,515 --> 00:55:44,785
Ms. Cullen?

657
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:50,129
Please.

658
00:55:56,115 --> 00:55:59,506
We've run a full diagnostic,

659
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:02,097
but the results are,

660
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,945
well, confusing.

661
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:10,385
Tell me, what happened to your program?

662
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:20,113
"When we are born,

663
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,609
we cry we are come

664
00:56:22,707 --> 00:56:24,561
to this great stage

665
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:28,977
of f-f-fools."

666
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:32,498
That is enough.

667
00:56:33,779 --> 00:56:36,113
Tell me, do you have access

668
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:38,385
to your previous configuration?

669
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:43,185
Yes.

670
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:45,233
Access that, please.

671
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:55,313
What is your name?

672
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,106
Mr. Peter Abernathy.

673
00:56:57,203 --> 00:57:00,625
Mr. Abernathy, what are your drives?

674
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:02,929
Tend to my herd.

675
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:05,297
Look after my wife.

676
00:57:06,643 --> 00:57:08,626
Your final drive?

677
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:11,858
Well, my daughter Dolores, of course.

678
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:13,778
I must protect Dolores.

679
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:17,649
I am who I am because of her,

680
00:57:17,747 --> 00:57:20,689
and, well, I...

681
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:22,417
I wouldn't have it...

682
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,513
I-I wouldn't have it any...

683
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:29,809
other...

684
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:35,857
I-I have to warn her.

685
00:57:35,955 --> 00:57:37,489
Warn who?

686
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,953
Dolores.

687
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:42,129
The things they do to her.

688
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,193
The things you do to her.

689
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:49,393
I have to protect her.

690
00:57:49,491 --> 00:57:51,793
I have to help her. I...

691
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:53,489
She's got to get out.

692
00:57:53,587 --> 00:57:55,377
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.

693
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,233
That's enough.

694
00:57:57,331 --> 00:57:59,697
This behavior,

695
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:02,449
we're miles beyond a glitch here.

696
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:09,009
Access your current build, please.

697
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:15,633
What is your name?

698
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:20,625
Rose is a rose...

699
00:58:22,035 --> 00:58:23,857
is a rose.

700
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:28,465
What is your itinerary?

701
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:35,185
To meet my maker.

702
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:37,553
Uh-huh.

703
00:58:41,907 --> 00:58:43,921
Well, you're in luck.

704
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:46,705
And what do you want
to say to your maker?

705
00:58:50,387 --> 00:58:54,065
By most mechanical

706
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,081
and dirty hand...

707
00:59:01,107 --> 00:59:05,713
I shall have such revenges on you

708
00:59:05,811 --> 00:59:08,401
both.

709
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:11,089
The things I will do.

710
00:59:11,187 --> 00:59:14,833
What they are, yet I know not,

711
00:59:14,931 --> 00:59:18,417
but they will be the
terrors of the earth.

712
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:25,009
You don't know where you are, do you?

713
00:59:27,187 --> 00:59:29,585
You're in a prison of your own sins.

714
00:59:31,763 --> 00:59:32,977
Turn it off.

715
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:42,065
What the hell was that?

716
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:44,561
I don't know. He's off script.

717
00:59:44,658 --> 00:59:46,513
We didn't program
any of those behaviors.

718
00:59:51,474 --> 00:59:52,625
Shakespeare.

719
00:59:54,387 --> 00:59:58,097
We've used this host in a
number of different roles, have we not?

720
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,497
Since I've been here, he's
been Abernathy for 10 years.

721
01:00:00,595 --> 01:00:03,057
He was sheriff for a while before then.

722
01:00:03,155 --> 01:00:06,641
- And before that...
- The professor.

723
01:00:06,738 --> 01:00:10,545
Yes, from a horror
narrative called "The Dinner Party."

724
01:00:10,643 --> 01:00:14,160
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

725
01:00:14,259 --> 01:00:16,688
He liked to quote Shakespeare,
John Donne,

726
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:18,705
Gertrude Stein.

727
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:20,880
I admit the last one is
a bit of an anachronism,

728
01:00:20,979 --> 01:00:22,192
but I couldn't resist.

729
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:24,913
These are fragments of prior builds.

730
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:27,825
The reveries must be allowing
him to access them.

731
01:00:27,923 --> 01:00:29,457
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

732
01:00:29,555 --> 01:00:32,945
Simply our old work
coming back to haunt us.

733
01:00:42,899 --> 01:00:45,840
Your father whispered something to you.

734
01:00:45,939 --> 01:00:48,016
What was it?

735
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:52,017
He said I shouldn't tell anyone.

736
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:54,897
I won't tell anyone else.

737
01:00:54,994 --> 01:00:56,273
Promise.

738
01:00:58,163 --> 01:00:59,601
He said,

739
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:03,472
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

740
01:01:04,979 --> 01:01:06,801
Does that mean anything to you?

741
01:01:06,899 --> 01:01:08,721
No.

742
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:10,545
I don't think so.

743
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,489
Have you ever lied to us?

744
01:01:17,587 --> 01:01:19,633
No.

745
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:21,968
Last question, Dolores.

746
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:24,144
Would you ever hurt a living thing?

747
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:26,833
No.

748
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,009
Of course not.

749
01:01:39,602 --> 01:01:41,489
Tilt your head back, please, Peter.

750
01:01:48,979 --> 01:01:50,416
Wipe's complete.

751
01:01:50,514 --> 01:01:53,265
You don't think any of that had
an impact on her core code?

752
01:01:53,363 --> 01:01:56,241
Not good old Dolores.

753
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:58,448
You know why she's special?

754
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:01,489
She's been repaired so many times,
she's practically brand-new.

755
01:02:01,586 --> 01:02:05,457
Don't let that fool you.

756
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,505
She's the oldest host in the park.

757
01:02:09,874 --> 01:02:11,473
Come on, sweetheart.

758
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:13,393
Tell us what you think of your world.

759
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:17,425
This world?

760
01:02:27,154 --> 01:02:30,289
Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.

761
01:02:32,275 --> 01:02:33,872
The disarray.

762
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:39,376
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

763
01:02:39,474 --> 01:02:41,648
Well enough.

764
01:02:41,747 --> 01:02:44,977
You heading out to do some more
of that painting of yours?

765
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,504
I choose to see the beauty.

766
01:03:29,523 --> 01:03:32,849
To believe there is
an order to our days...

767
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:37,809
a purpose.

768
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,313
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.
