            <i> to build</i>
            <i> some new narrative?</i>

142
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,518
          Can I bum a cigarette?

143
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,158
        God, I see why
        you took these up again.

144
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,038
               Let me remind you
               of something.

145
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,197
      This place, the people
      who work here are nothing.

146
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,078
   Our interest
   in this place is entirely
   in the intellectual property.

147
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,838
                   The code.

148
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,958
  The hosts' minds,
  the storylines--

149
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,398
       <i> I don't give a rat's ass</i>
       <i> about the hosts.</i>

150
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,398
         It's our little
         research project
         that Delos cares about.

151
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,358
            That's where
            the real value is.

152
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,558
            <i> And due to</i>
            <i> a lack of foresight</i>

153
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,357
            <i> on part of one</i>
            <i> of my predecessors,</i>

154
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,718
               35 years
               of information--

155
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,918
               raw information--
               exists here.

156
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,598
                 Nowhere else.

157
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,638
                 Ford has always
                 ensured that.

158
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,398
           Now, you are
           a smart enough woman.

159
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,838
           Tell me,
           why would we need you
           to secure all of it?

160
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,797
  Because you're
  going to fire him.

161
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,158
          You don't fire someone
          who created an empire.

162
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,358
            You ask him
            to retire politely.

163
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,117
            And if that person
            has the ability to
            snap his fingers

164
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,798
           and erase the value
           of that empire,

165
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,398
       you have to make sure
       you have a contingency.

166
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,718
          So, you and I
         need to ensure

167
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,597
 that by the time
 the rest of the board arrives,

168
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,638
      we are on course
      for that transition.

169
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,998
                Okay?

170
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,838
                    <i> I like you.</i>

171
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,597
    Well, not personally,
    but I like you for this job,

172
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,797
         <i> which is why I'm gonna</i>
        <i> give you another chance</i>

173
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,558
           to get a handle
           on this particular
           bitch of a situation.

174
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,158
              But the gods...

175
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,478
              they require
              a blood sacrifice.

176
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,198
         <i> We need to demonstrate</i>
         <i> just how dangerous</i>

177
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,318
                Ford's creations
                can be.

178
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,398
                          No.

179
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,158
        ( chuckles )
        No, nothing so obvious.

180
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,878
          We need someone
          thoroughly unexpected.

181
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,638
        ( piano playing )

182
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,198
           ( chatter )

183
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,957
         ( piano stops )

184
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,718
      I told you never open
      your mouth that wide

185
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,518
     unless someone's
     paying you for it.

186
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,677
                  <i> Sorry, Maeve.</i>

187
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,878
            I didn't sleep much
            last night.

188
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,318
      What are these nightmares
      you have about?

189
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,118
     Do you ever dream
     you're someone else?

190
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,238
           I don't think so.

191
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,238
                   Why?

192
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,478
    You ever thought about
    whether this is really
    the life you want?

193
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,518
          I don't
          intend to make this
          my life's work.

194
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,918
               No offense.

195
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,157
           Mm.

196
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,757
             My family's
             got a farm.

197
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,037
            Bad soil.
            Nothing grows.

198
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,677
            I send money
            back to them.

199
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,478
              They think I work
              in a dress shop.
              ( chuckles )

200
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,398
                   What's wrong?

201
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:33,437
           I'm just doing
           what you told me to.

202
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,638
           A couple more years
           of this and...

203
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,917
           then I can have
           whatever life I want.

204
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,997
        <i> I'm gonna get my family</i>
        <i> out of the desert.</i>

205
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,318
             We're gonna go
             somewhere...

206
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,918
                 cold.

207
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,238
                    Someday.

208
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,558
         <i> ( door opens )</i>

209
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,237
           Man:
           Which one is it?

210
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,478
           Man #2:
           It's the one
           at the bar. Go.

211
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,838
       Quick, before
       the guests upstairs
       finish up.

212
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,117
Whatever she did,
it must've been serious

213
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,358
     if they're making us
     grab her in broad daylight.

214
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,677
             <i> ( tablet beeping )</i>

215
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,237
                    Man #2:
                    We got her.
                    Let's go.

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,238
       ( chatter resumes )

217
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,478
               You're supposed
               to be resting.

218
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,037
     We're riding a train
     full with explosives
     through scalping territory.

219
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,517
               Not sleepy.

220
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,598
               Can I ask you
               something?

221
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,637
           This place
           you're looking for,

222
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,438
           what makes you
           so sure it exists?

223
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,278
     I'm not.

224
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,757
My life before,
I was so sure of the world.

225
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,837
 But now it feels
 like a lie.

226
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,797
Only thing I know
is whatever's out there,
I'm never going back.

227
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,277
    What is it
    you're looking for?

228
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,157
   Lawrence is right.

229
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,597
      You could've
    stayed in Pariah
      or gone back,

230
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,958
   but you're here.

231
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,677
        With me.

232
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,117
               ( chuckles )

233
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,877
           The only thing I had
           when I was a kid
           were books.

234
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,718
         I used to live in them.

235
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,358
          <i> I used to go to sleep</i>

236
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,757

           <i> inside one of them</i>

237
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,957
                <i> 'cause they had</i>
                <i> meaning.</i>

238
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:39,277
  <i> This place,</i>
  <i> this is like I woke up</i>
  <i> inside one of those stories.</i>

239
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:43,117
        I guess I just wanna
        find out what it means.

240
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,038
 I don't wanna be
 in a story.

241
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,237
All I want is to not
look forward or back.

242
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,958
 I just wanna be...

243
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,437
 in the moment I'm in.

244
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,758
            Dolores,

245
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,837
    back home,
    there's a woman, Juliet,

246
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,917
             and her father
            owns the company
              where I work.

247
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,878
     She's, uh,
     Logan's sister.

248
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,398
                       Yeah.

249
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,997
          And when I get home,
          we're getting married.

250
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,197
        Oh.

251
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,637
         The place you're after,
        I will help you find it.

252
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,517
               But I can't stay.

253
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,397
               I have a life
               waiting for me.

254
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,758
                     I'm sorry.

255
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,558
   Of course.

256
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,757
            Dolores.

257
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,958
I've been pretending
my whole life.

258
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,078
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

259
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,998
My life's built on it.

260
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,878
And it's a good life.
It's a life I've always wanted.

261
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,757
But then I came here

262
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,557
and I get a glimpse
for a second

263
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,877
of a life in which
I don't have to pretend.

264
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,838
A life in which
I can be truly alive.

265
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:02,717
    How can I go back
    to pretending

266
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,197
    when I know
    what this feels like?

267
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,557
        ( both panting )

268
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,637
    ( gasps )

269
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,437
                     Dr. Ford:
                    <i> Miss Hale.</i>

270
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,597
      I was not aware those
      with your level of insight

271
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,077
            needed any more
            reflection.

272
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,597
        Dr. Ford.
        Always charming.

273
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,717
     What is this?

274
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,957
        Apparently, Miss Cullen
        and Miss Hale

275
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,677
            <i> have a presentation</i>
            <i> for us.</i>

276
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,477
What about?

277
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,877
    Following the recent reports
    of host malfunction,

278
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,797
      <i> we asked QA to check</i>
      <i> the last abortive update,</i>

279
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,197
            which featured
             the reveries,

280
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,517
        -<i> as I believe</i>
        <i> they're called.</i>
        - Mm-hmm.

281
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,677
            I'm sorry to report
            that Miss Cullen
            and her team

282
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:39,397
            <i> uncovered some</i>
            <i> worrisome findings.</i>

283
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:41,237
             In the course
             of our code review,

284
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,878
              we found something
               quite disturbing.

285
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,677
                   Wake her up.

286
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,797
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

287
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,597
             When we discovered
             the build was buggy

288
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:01,877
  due to a last-minute injection
  of the reverie code,

289
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,037
we quickly rolled
all the infected hosts
back to their prior builds.

290
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,557
         Mm, you're new.

291
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,198
     Not much
     of a rind on you.

292
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,957
                 ( grunts )

293
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,557
           ( labored breathing )

294
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,357
          - No!
          - ( grunts )

295
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:25,597
            <i> No! No!</i>

296
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:26,717
             No, no.

297
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:29,637
                   ( gasping )
                   No, no, no...

298
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,717
        ( gasps, grunts )

299
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,077
    Please. Please.

300
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,437
            Help me!

301
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,237
     Please, please, please!

302
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,997
   - No! ( screams )
   - All right, that's enough.

303
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,158
             Freeze.

304
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,277
As you've no doubt
gathered,

305
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,917
our tech is,
in fact, a host.

306
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,557
One that has been coded
for the purposes of
this simulation

307
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,157
     to read as a human.

308
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,157
And as you can see,
behavioral safeguards

309
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,597
are operating
exactly as you would expect.

310
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,157
      Reset her.
      Wipe her memory.

311
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,157
            ( gasps )

312
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,437
       Okay, let's do this
       again.

313
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,917
       ( inhales, gasps )

314
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,117
              You're new.

315
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,357
        Not much
        of a rind on you.

316
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,957

317
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:55,317

00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,277
          ( screaming )

321
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,237
 - Stubbs:
 <i> That's enough, sweetheart.</i>
 -<i> ( gun cocks )</i>

322
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,957
                  That's enough.

323
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,317
   Freeze
   all motor functions.

324
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,757
      <i> Freeze</i>
      <i> all motor functions.</i>

325
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,277
<i>Freeze</i>
<i>all motor functions.</i>

326
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,597

          - ( gasps )

328
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,077
In each case we examined,
the malfunctioning hosts

329
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,757
were not resetting
properly.

330
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,877
         <i> The retention of data</i>
         <i> that hadn't been wiped</i>

             <i> a system failure</i>

333
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:03,997
     <i> that allowed for override</i>

334
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,077
              <i> The concern</i>
              <i> with the reveries</i>

335
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,957

    <i> the hosts will remember</i>
    <i> some of their experiences</i>

336
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,397
                and act on them.

337
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:12,757
 You're telling us
 that these hosts

338
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,757
  were responding
  to a grudge?

339
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,237
               That's exactly
               what I'm saying,
               Mr. Lowe.

340
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,477
      <i> And funny you should use</i>
      <i> that particular word,</i>
      <i> "grudge,"</i>

341
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,517
           <i> since what was</i>
           <i> most troubling to me</i>

342
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,477
          was that several techs
          in behavior

343
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,317
           voiced these
           exact same concerns

344
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,957
           <i> to the head</i>
           <i> of their department.</i>

345
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:32,597
         <i> You put this code out</i>
         <i> without proper vetting</i>

346
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:35,877
        <i> and without reasonable</i>
        <i> understanding of its</i>
        <i> ramifications.</i>

347
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,117
         So, either you
         didn't write it

348
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,517
                <i> or you're</i>
                <i> getting sloppy</i>

349
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,717
         to the point of risking
        the lives of our guests.

350
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:45,517
     Few things surprise me
     anymore, Mr. Lowe,

351
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,797
    but this level of negligence
    is fucking breathtaking.

352
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,277
             We are way beyond
             rollback territory.

353
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,837
                 Within the next
                 six months,

354
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,557
            we'll need
            to rebuild the hosts

355
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,637
           from the ground up.

356
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,237
     You want us
     to lobotomize them
     is what you're saying.

357
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,597
     No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

358
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,157
           <i> After all, this was</i>
           <i> your responsibility,</i>

359
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:08,517
       <i> assuming that you have</i>
       <i> nothing to share with us</i>

360

           <i> of your culpability.</i>

361
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,597
               No.

362
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,277
       Then you're fired.

363
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,557
          ( chuckles )

364
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,276
            William:
              <i> Hey.</i>

365
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,717
             Morning, William.

366
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,877
               I-- I didn't
               wanna wake you.

367
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,317
         I know...

368
00:28:15,358 --> 00:28:17,197
                last night
                was unexpected.

369
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,756
          If you regret it...

370
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,637
     I don't regret a thing.

371
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,357
         I know you have someone
        waiting for you at home.

372
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:33,517
     All that feels
     so unreal now.

373
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,877
I used to think this place
was all about...

374
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,917
pandering to your
baser instincts.

375
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:43,037
    Now I understand.

376
00:28:43,078 --> 00:28:44,917
  It doesn't cater
  to your lowest self,

377
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,477
  it reveals
  your deepest self.

378
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,317
  It shows you
  who you really are.

379
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:55,556
 You remember
 the look on Logan's face
 when we left him behind?

380
00:28:57,198 --> 00:28:58,877
  Do you know how long
  I've wanted to do that,

381
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,837
    to let him know
    what I think of him?

382
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:03,717
And you,
last night,

383
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,717
   I've never
   felt that way before,
   not with any woman.

384
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,197
 You've unlocked
something in me.

385
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,756
         I'm not a key,
         William.

386
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,557
                    I'm just me.

387
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,116
    What is that?

388
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,197
                   I don't know.

389
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,797
                At home,
                I used to paint.

390
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:32,316
        Landscapes mostly,
        but I was always just...

391
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,197
           copying the world
           outside me.

392
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:37,677
      This morning,
      I woke up and I thought...

393
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,197
             "What if I drew
             something new?"

394
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,157
      I imagined
      something beautiful.

395
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,797
     A place where
     the mountains meet the sea.

396
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,556
Everyone who comes here
is longing for excitement
or conflict,

397
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,957
     and you're just...

398
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,717
 dreaming of the opposite.

399
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,477
      Well, what about you,
      William?

400
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,397
      What do you dream of?

00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,677
    - Ambush.

442
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,156
              what I dreamt.

443
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,596
        It's the place you drew.

444
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,837
Lawrence:

                they'll be
                coming after us.

447
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:24,557
     My friends here are itching
     to join the war effort.

448
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,077
         Think I've had
         enough of war.

449
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:28,756
              How about you?

451
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:35,717
          I'm afraid this
          is where we part ways.

452
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,076
                Careful.

453
00:35:38,118 --> 00:35:40,316
         If you're heading west
         across that river,

454
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,997
            you may be leaving
            the fighting behind,

455
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:43,956
       but you're gonna be
       in unclaimed territories.

456
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:47,516
   What's out that way?

457
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:49,797
              You're gonna have
              to ask the dust.

458
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,676
      Ain't nothing
      ever come back from there.

We're almost done here.

462
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,996
Why don't I close up?

463
00:36:28,278 --> 00:36:30,716
       Lutz:
       <i> You've been topside</i>
       <i> for less than 24 hours.</i>

464
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:33,557
     You keep
     coming down this often,
     people are going to notice.

465
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:35,316
         - Where's Clem?
         - I don't know.

466
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,717
       I haven't seen her.
       Why?

467
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:39,396
            Find her.
            Now.

468
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:50,157
                        What?

469
00:36:50,198 --> 00:36:51,876
              Where is she?

470
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,396
I don't know.

471
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,876
              She's here.
              Let's go.

472
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:01,036
    We can't.
    The brass will be there.

473
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,717
        You don't want
        to fuck with me, Felix.

474
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:07,476
          Take me there now.

475
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:16,676
                  Slow down.

476
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,997
Tilt your head back,
please, Clem.

477
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:40,237
      - Is there a problem?
      - No.

478
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:41,836
    ( drill whirring )

479
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:42,996
           Sylvester:
             <i> Sorry.</i>

480
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:07,436
                Theresa.

481
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:11,757
            May I have a word?

482
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:15,316
                        Sure.

483
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:25,676
        <i> ( drill stops )</i>

484
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:33,916
I appreciate
your professionalism,

485
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,637
but you really don't
need to bother with this,

486
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,036
given the change
in your employment status.

487
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:38,476
         The test was a sham.

488
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,076
            The little show
            you and Hale put on?

489
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,316
   Completely transparent
   from a technical perspective,

490
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,997
  clumsy to the point of
  making me embarrassed for you.

491
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,436
     - Embarrassed?
     - If I saw through it,

492
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:47,636
         I can only imagine
         what Ford was thinking.

493
00:38:47,678 --> 00:38:49,156
           There were glaringly
           obvious markers

494
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:51,036
           of human intervention
           in the code.

495
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,036
 If your programmers
were any good, they'd
 be working for me.

496
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:55,876
And I know you and your team
were responsible for the stray

497
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,516
   and its satellite
   transmission.

498
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,476
         - Bernie--
         - I don't care.

499
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:04,516
        40 years ago,

500
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:07,716
   Ford's partner
   wrote half the code
   this place was founded on.

501
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:09,836
          What you said
          in the lab
          was right.

502
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,556
       We don't know
       how the hosts work,

503
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:13,596
and I think there's
something wrong with them.

504
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:16,396
Ford's explanation
only bolsters my hunch.

505
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:20,477
   The ability to deviate
    from program behavior

506
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:23,476
  arises out of the host's
  recall of past iterations.

507
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:26,676
      You're thinking
      there's a connection
      between memory and--

508
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:29,556
   And improvisation, yes.

509
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:32,316
        Out of repetition
        comes variation.

510
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,796
      And after countless
      cycles of repetition,

511
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:37,796
       these hosts,
       they were varying.

512
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:40,836
  They were on the verge
  of some kind of change.

513
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:50,036
        You have to know
        my chief concern

514
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:54,116
     has always been
     the well-being of this park
     and the people in it.

515
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,597
        I know.

516
00:39:57,118 --> 00:39:59,116
     Which is why I need
     to show you something.

517
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:02,636
       ( elevator beeps )

518
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,956
    - Sylvester:<i> Talk to her.</i>
    - Lutz:<i> You first.</i>

519
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:29,236
             Look, I didn't want
             to retire her.

520
00:40:29,278 --> 00:40:32,236
             <i> I know she's,</i>
             <i> like, your friend,</i>

521
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:34,676
                  <i> or-- I guess.</i>

522
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:37,356
            ( sighs )

523
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:40,196
            <i> But-- but</i>
            <i> if I didn't do it,</i>

524
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,916
           <i> they-- they'd just</i>
           <i> get someone else to,</i>

525
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,676
        <i> and then they'd be</i>
        <i> suspicious of me, so...</i>

526
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:49,396
                 <i> so I said yes.</i>

527
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:52,276
                   <i> But I did it</i>
                   <i> for you.</i>

528
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:58,356
       Always doing things
       for other people,
       aren't you?

529
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:02,996
         Time to do
         one more thing.

530
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,596
            What?

531
00:41:07,638 --> 00:41:11,756
      All my life,
      I've prided myself
      on being a survivor.

532
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:16,356
      But surviving
      is just another loop.

533
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:22,476
    I'm getting out of here.

534
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,916
        You two are going
           to help me.

535
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,276
           ( scoffs )

536
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:30,956
     No. Do...

537
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:35,156
             Do you know how far
            these people will go

538
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:36,716
            to protect their IP?

539
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:42,996
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

540
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:46,036
        is made
        to keep you here.

541
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:49,556
                ( sighs )

542
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,436
       It-- it'd be
       a suicide mission.

543
00:41:56,678 --> 00:42:00,036
  At first, I thought you
  and the others were gods.

544
00:42:02,118 --> 00:42:05,036
         Then I realized
        you're just men.

545
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,676
         And I know men.

546
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,916
      You think I'm scared
            of death?

547
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:18,636
          I've done it
        a million times.

548
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:22,316
 I'm fucking
great at it.

549
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:26,436
         How many times
         have you died?

550
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,076
      Because if you don't
           help me...

551
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:34,796
         I'll kill you.

552
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,356
          ( chuckles )

553
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:44,676
            If there's a problem
            in the park,

554
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:46,316
               should we bring
              a security team?

555
00:42:47,638 --> 00:42:49,876
  Who would we trust?

556
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:51,756
Thought I could trust you,
for instance.

557
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:55,956
        I'm not going to explain
         myself to you, Bernard.

558
00:42:55,998 --> 00:43:00,116
         I was charged with
         safeguarding the park's
         intellectual property.

559
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:01,756
Why would it be in danger?

560
00:43:01,798 --> 00:43:04,036
You were the only one
who was stealing it.

561
00:43:04,078 --> 00:43:06,516
            Delos owns
            the hosts' minds,

562
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:08,876
             the storylines,
            decades of work.

563
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:12,036
       Ford never
       allowed any of it
       to be backed up off-site.

564
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:13,516
        All of this
        could've been destroyed.

565
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,636
  In the event of what?

566
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:17,996
               Ford is done,
               Bernard.

567
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:19,716
      The board has indulged him
      for long enough.

568
00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:21,116
                   He is done.

569
00:43:21,158 --> 00:43:22,916
                 The corporation
                 was concerned

570
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:25,756
        he'd destroy
        all of the park's IP
        on his way out the door.

571
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:28,876
  You think I would've let him
  destroy all of the hosts,
  all of our work?

572
00:43:28,918 --> 00:43:32,756
          There's far more
          at stake here than
          the hosts' profiles.

573
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:36,476
          Do you really think
          the corporation's
          interest here

574
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:38,956
            are tourists
            playing cowboy?

575
00:43:42,158 --> 00:43:44,796
The longer I work here,

576
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:47,716
the more I think
I understand the hosts.

577
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,756
It's the human beings
who confuse me.

578
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,836
     <i> ( crickets chirping )</i>

579
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:27,956
      This building isn't
      in any survey of the park.

580
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:30,916
     That's because we use hosts
     to do most of the surveys.

581
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,756
          They're programmed
          to ignore this place.

582
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:35,156
               They literally
               couldn't see it

583
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:37,356
            if they were
            staring right at it.

584
00:44:39,158 --> 00:44:41,835
And these unregistered hosts
you told me about?

585
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:43,475
          I don't know.

586
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:45,716
   He may have moved them.

587
00:44:45,758 --> 00:44:47,595
What's behind
this door?

588
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:52,115
                      What door?

589
00:45:15,157 --> 00:45:16,996
            Theresa:
      <i> What is this place?</i>

590
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:20,396
            Bernard:
         <i> It's a remote</i>
      <i> diagnostic facility.</i>

591
00:45:20,438 --> 00:45:22,396
      <i> Ford and his partner</i>
    <i> used them when the park</i>
          <i> was in beta.</i>

592
00:45:22,437 --> 00:45:24,676
         <i> I had no idea</i>
       <i> this one was here.</i>

593
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:26,316
The cottage must've
been built on top of it.

594
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:28,076
         But this equipment.

595
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:32,035
 This is newer.

596
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:34,676
            <i> Slower</i>
            <i> than our machines</i>
            <i> back at the mesa,</i>

597
00:45:34,718 --> 00:45:37,116
      <i> but it will render a host</i>
      <i> in a few days.</i>

598
00:45:37,158 --> 00:45:40,836
          So, Ford's been making
          his own hosts out here
          and telling no one.

599
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:08,396
            What's the matter?

600
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:12,075
              Um...

601
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:15,276
      Have you seen these?

602
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,156
        What is this, Bernard?

603
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:30,796
    Doesn't look
    like anything to me.

604
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:33,875
            Dr. Ford:
   <i> They cannot see the things</i>
      <i> that will hurt them.</i>

605
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:36,396
     I've spared them that.

606
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:41,956
   <i> Their lives are blissful.</i>

607
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:46,676
       In a way, their existence
       is purer than ours,

608
00:46:46,718 --> 00:46:50,195
freed of the burden
of self-doubt.

609
00:46:52,038 --> 00:46:54,156
             No, no, no, no.
             I don't understand.

610
00:47:00,477 --> 00:47:02,436
            You're a fucking
            monster.

611
00:47:02,478 --> 00:47:04,436
              Am I?

612
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:07,075
     Well, you were the one
     who would so blithely
     destroy all of them,

613
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:08,796
      even him, I suppose.

614
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:11,875
        <i> After everything</i>
        <i> you have shared.</i>

615
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:16,036
          What the hell
     are you talking about?

616
00:47:19,957 --> 00:47:21,516
         Is that why...?

617
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:27,115
     Did you tell him to--?

618
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:29,476
            Dr. Ford:
         <i> The intimacies</i>
        <i> were your idea,</i>

619
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:31,996
       if you will recall.

620
00:47:32,037 --> 00:47:34,915
         I think Bernard
    was glad of the company.

621
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:37,476
                   Bernard:
                   <i> I'm not one.</i>

622
00:47:37,517 --> 00:47:39,356
           I can't be.

623
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,876
            My wife.

624
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:44,876
             My son.

625
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:47,716
                    <i> The burial.</i>

626
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:49,516
                <i> I was a father.</i>

627
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:50,796
                   <i> My poor boy.</i>

628
00:47:50,837 --> 00:47:53,995
      ( labored breathing )

629
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,396
  That's enough, Bernard.

630
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:57,476
         ( powers down )

631
00:47:57,518 --> 00:47:59,236
   You mustn't get
   yourself worked up.

632
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:08,556
            I read a theory once

633
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:11,395
      that the human intellect
      was like peacock feathers.

634
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:15,676
     Just an extravagant display
     intended to attract a mate.

635
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,596
        <i> All of art, literature,</i>
        <i> a bit of Mozart,</i>

636
00:48:17,638 --> 00:48:19,516
           <i> William Shakespeare,</i>
           <i> Michelangelo,</i>

637
00:48:19,558 --> 00:48:21,796
               <i> and the Empire</i>
               <i> State Building--</i>

638
00:48:21,837 --> 00:48:24,756
               just an elaborate
               mating ritual.

639
00:48:25,957 --> 00:48:27,315
            <i> Maybe</i>
            <i> it doesn't matter</i>

640
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:29,556
           <i> that we have</i>
           <i> accomplished so much</i>

641
00:48:29,598 --> 00:48:32,356
         for the basest
           of reasons.

642
00:48:32,397 --> 00:48:35,156
         But, of course,
   the peacock can barely fly.

643
00:48:35,198 --> 00:48:39,515
      It lives in the dirt,
pecking insects out of the muck,

644
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:43,596
        consoling itself
     with its great beauty.

645
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:52,516
      <i> I have come to think of</i>
      <i> so much of consciousness</i>
      <i> as a burden,</i>

646
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:56,196
             <i> a weight,</i>
             <i> and we have</i>
             <i> spared them that.</i>

647
00:48:57,237 --> 00:49:01,796
        Anxiety,
        self-loathing, guilt.

648
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,676
     The hosts are the ones
     who are free.

649
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:09,516
        Free here
        under my control.

650
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:16,395
          But he's not
       under your control.

651
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:23,275
    He brought me here
    to show me this.

652
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:26,155
       No. He brought you here
       because I asked him to.

653
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:34,795
      He's been very loyal
      for many years.

654
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:41,596
      Your time
      running this place

655
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,555
     like your insane
     little kingdom

656
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:45,635
           is over.

657
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,315
You've been playing God
for long enough.

658
00:49:49,357 --> 00:49:52,436
            I simply wanted
            to tell my stories.

659
00:49:52,477 --> 00:49:54,876
          It was you people
          who wanted to play God

660
00:49:54,918 --> 00:49:56,676
           with your
           little undertaking.

661
00:49:56,717 --> 00:50:00,315
    Do you really think
    the board will stand
    for this?

662
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:02,355
                ( chuckles )

663
00:50:06,997 --> 00:50:09,116
             The board
             will do nothing.

664
00:50:09,158 --> 00:50:11,835
        Our arrangement
        is too valuable to them.

665
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:13,276
            <i> They test me</i>
            <i> every now and then.</i>

666
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:15,955
             <i> I think they enjoy</i>
             <i> the sport of it.</i>

667
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:18,036
               This time,
               they sent you.

668
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:26,795
          Sadly, in order
          to restore things,

669
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:29,355
         the situation demands

670
00:50:29,397 --> 00:50:32,515
           a blood sacrifice.

671
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:39,915
           <i> See, Arnold and I</i>
           <i> designed every part</i>
           <i> of this place.</i>

672
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:42,356
           It was our dream.

673
00:50:42,397 --> 00:50:43,836
          Did you really think

674
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:47,915
             I would let you
            take it from me?

675
00:50:52,997 --> 00:50:54,956
   This is what happened
   to Arnold?

676
00:50:57,397 --> 00:51:00,156
Did you have Bernard
take him out into the woods?

677
00:51:00,198 --> 00:51:01,956
              No, he wasn't here
              in those days.

678
00:51:01,997 --> 00:51:02,916
              Were you, Bernard?

679
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:16,916
           ( beeping )

680
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:29,516
          Like I said,

681
00:51:29,557 --> 00:51:32,995
      I built all of this.

682
00:51:36,678 --> 00:51:39,475
            I'm afraid our guest
            has grown weary.

683
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:41,075
              Perhaps you can
              help her, Bernard.

684
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:55,115
                    No.

685
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:58,756
          "And in that sleep,
          what dreams may come."

686
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:02,875
            Bernard.
